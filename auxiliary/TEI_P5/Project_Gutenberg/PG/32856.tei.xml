<head>Preface.</head>

<p>
My Lectures on the Science of Language are here
printed as I had prepared them in manuscript for the
Royal Institution. When I came to deliver them, a
considerable portion of what I had written had to be
omitted; and, in now placing them before the public in
a more complete form, I have gladly complied with a
wish expressed by many of my hearers. As they are,
they only form a short abstract of several Courses
delivered from time to time in Oxford, and they do not
pretend to be more than an introduction to a science
far too comprehensive to be treated successfully in so
small a compass.
</p>

<p>
My object, however, will have been attained, if I
should succeed in attracting the attention, not only
of the scholar, but of the philosopher, the historian,
and the theologian, to a science which concerns them
all, and which, though it professes to treat of words
only, teaches us that there is more in words than is
dreamt of in our philosophy. I quote from Bacon:
<q>Men believe that their reason is lord over their
<pb n='viii'/><anchor id='Pgviii'/>
words, but it happens, too, that words exercise a
reciprocal and reactionary power over our intellect.
Words, as a Tartar's bow, shoot back upon the understanding
of the wisest, and mightily entangle and pervert
the judgment.</q>

<head>Lecture I. The Science Of Language One Of The Physical
Sciences.</head>

<p>
When I was asked some time ago to deliver a
course of lectures on Comparative Philology in this
Institution, I at once expressed my readiness to do so.
I had lived long enough in England to know that the
peculiar difficulties arising from my imperfect knowledge
of the language would be more than balanced by
the forbearance of an English audience, and I had
such perfect faith in my subject that I thought it might
be trusted even in the hands of a less skilful expositor.
I felt convinced that the researches into the history of
languages and into the nature of human speech which
have been carried on for the last fifty years in England,
France, and Germany, deserved a larger share
of public sympathy than they had hitherto received;
and it seemed to me, as far as I could judge, that
the discoveries in this newly-opened mine of scientific
inquiry were not inferior, whether in novelty or
importance, to the most brilliant discoveries of our
age.
</p>

<pb n='012'/><anchor id='Pg012'/>

<p>
It was not till I began to write my lectures that I
became aware of the difficulties of the task I had
undertaken. The dimensions of the science of language
are so vast that it is impossible in a course of
nine lectures to give more than a very general survey
of it; and as one of the greatest charms of this science
consists in the minuteness of the analysis by which
each language, each dialect, each word, each grammatical
form is tested, I felt that it was almost impossible
to do full justice to my subject, or to place the achievements
of those who founded and fostered the science
of language in their true light. Another difficulty
arises from the dryness of many of the problems which
I shall have to discuss. Declensions and conjugations
cannot be made amusing, nor can I avail myself of
the advantages possessed by most lecturers, who enliven
their discussions by experiments and diagrams.
If, with all these difficulties and drawbacks, I do not
shrink from opening to-day this course of lectures on
mere words, on nouns and verbs and particles,&mdash;if I
venture to address an audience accustomed to listen, in
this place, to the wonderful tales of the natural historian,
the chemist, and geologist, and wont to see the
novel results of inductive reasoning invested by native
eloquence, with all the charms of poetry and romance,&mdash;it
is because, though mistrusting myself, I cannot
mistrust my subject. The study of words may be
tedious to the school-boy, as breaking of stones is to
the wayside laborer; but to the thoughtful eye of the
geologist these stones are full of interest;&mdash;he sees
miracles on the high-road, and reads chronicles in every
ditch. Language, too, has marvels of her own, which
she unveils to the inquiring glance of the patient
<pb n='013'/><anchor id='Pg013'/>
student. There are chronicles below her surface;
there are sermons in every word. Language has
been called sacred ground, because it is the deposit
of thought. We cannot tell as yet what language is.
It may be a production of nature, a work of human
art, or a divine gift. But to whatever sphere it belongs,
it would seem to stand unsurpassed&mdash;nay,
unequalled in it&mdash;by anything else. If it be a production
of nature, it is her last and crowning production
which she reserved for man alone. If it be a
work of human art, it would seem to lift the human
artist almost to the level of a divine creator. If it be
the gift of God, it is God's greatest gift; for through
it God spake to man and man speaks to God in worship,
prayer, and meditation.
</p>

<p>
Although the way which is before us may be long
and tedious, the point to which it tends would seem to
be full of interest; and I believe I may promise that
the view opened before our eyes from the summit of
our science, will fully repay the patient travellers, and
perhaps secure a free pardon to their venturous guide.
</p>

<milestone unit='tb' rend='rule: 50%'/>

<p>
The Science of Language is a science of very modern
date. We cannot trace its lineage much beyond
the beginning of our century, and it is scarcely received
as yet on a footing of equality by the elder
branches of learning. Its very name is still unsettled,
and the various titles that have been given to it in
England, France, and Germany are so vague and varying
that they have led to the most confused ideas
among the public at large as to the real objects of this
new science. We hear it spoken of as Comparative
Philology, Scientific Etymology, Phonology, and Glossology.
<pb n='014'/><anchor id='Pg014'/>
In France it has received the convenient, but
somewhat barbarous, name of <foreign lang='fr' rend='italic'>Linguistique</foreign>. If we
must have a Greek title for our science, we might
derive it either from <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>mythos</foreign>,
word, or from <foreign lang='el' rend='italic'>logos</foreign>,
speech. But the title of <emph>Mythology</emph> is already occupied,
and <hi rend='italic'>Logology</hi> would jar too much on classical
ears. We need not waste our time in criticising these
names, as none of them has as yet received that universal
sanction which belongs to the titles of other
modern sciences, such as Geology or Comparative
Anatomy; nor will there be much difficulty in christening
our young science after we have once ascertained
its birth, its parentage, and its character. I
myself prefer the simple designation of the Science
of Language, though in these days of high-sounding
titles, this plain name will hardly meet with general
acceptance.
</p>

<p>
From the name we now turn to the meaning of our
science. But before we enter upon a definition of its
subject-matter, and determine the method which ought
to be followed in our researches, it will be useful to cast
a glance at the history of the other sciences, among
which the science of language now, for the first time,
claims her place; and examine their origin, their
gradual progress, and definite settlement. The history
of a science is, as it were, its biography, and as
we buy experience cheapest in studying the lives of
others, we may, perhaps, guard our young science
from some of the follies and extravagances inherent
in youth by learning a lesson for which other
branches of human knowledge have had to pay more
dearly.
</p>

<p>
There is a certain uniformity in the history of most
<pb n='015'/><anchor id='Pg015'/>
sciences. If we read such works as Whewell's History
of the Inductive Sciences or Humboldt's Cosmos,
we find that the origin, the progress, the causes
of failure and success have been the same for almost
every branch of human knowledge. There are three
marked periods or stages in the history of every one
of them, which we may call the <emph>Empirical</emph>, the <emph>Classificatory</emph>,
and the <emph>Theoretical</emph>. However humiliating
it may sound, every one of our sciences, however
grand their present titles, can be traced back to the
most humble and homely occupations of half-savage
tribes. It was not the true, the good, and the beautiful
which spurred the early philosophers to deep
researches and bold discoveries. The foundation-stone
of the most glorious structures of human ingenuity
in ages to come was supplied by the pressing
wants of a patriarchal and semi-barbarous society.
The names of some of the most ancient departments
of human knowledge tell their own tale. Geometry,
which at present declares itself free from all sensuous
impressions, and treats of its points and lines and
planes as purely ideal conceptions, not to be confounded
with those coarse and imperfect representations
as they appear on paper to the human eye;
geometry, as its very name declares, began with
measuring a garden or a field. It is derived from
the Greek <emph>gē</emph>,
land, ground, earth, and <emph>metron</emph>, measure.
Botany, the science of plants, was originally
the science of <emph>botanē</emph>, which in Greek does not
mean a plant in general, but fodder, from
<emph>boskein</emph>, to feed.
The science of plants would have been called Phytology,
from the Greek <emph>phyton</emph>,
a plant.<note place='foot'>See Jessen, Was heisst Botanik? 1861.</note> The founders
<pb n='016'/><anchor id='Pg016'/>
of Astronomy were not the poet or the philosopher,
but the sailor and the farmer. The early poet may
have admired <q>the mazy dance of planets,</q> and the
philosopher may have speculated on the heavenly harmonies;
but it was to the sailor alone that a knowledge
of the glittering guides of heaven became a
question of life and death. It was he who calculated
their risings and settings with the accuracy of a merchant
and the shrewdness of an adventurer; and the
names that were given to single stars or constellations
clearly show that they were invented by the ploughers
of the sea and of the land. The moon, for instance,
the golden hand on the dark dial of heaven, was
called by them the Measurer,&mdash;the measurer of time;
for time was measured by nights, and moons, and
winters, long before it was reckoned by days, and
suns, and years. Moon<note place='foot'>Kuhn's Zeitschrift
für Vergleichende Sprachforschung, b. ix. s. 104.</note> is a very old word. It was
<emph>môna</emph> in Anglo-Saxon, and was used there, not as a
feminine, but as a masculine; for the moon was a masculine
in all Teutonic languages, and it is only through
the influence of classical models that in English moon
has been changed into a feminine, and sun into a masculine.
It was a most unlucky assertion which Mr. Harris
made in his <hi rend='italic'>Hermes</hi>, that all nations ascribe to the
sun a masculine, and to the moon a feminine gender.<note place='foot'>Horne
Tooke, p. 27, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi>.</note>
In Gothic moon is <emph>mena</emph>, which is a masculine. For
month we have in A.-S. <emph>mónâdh</emph>, in Gothic
<emph>menoth</emph>,
both masculine. In Greek we find <emph>mēn</emph>, a
masculine, for month, and <emph>mēnē</emph>,
a feminine, for moon. In Latin
we have the derivative <emph>mensis</emph>, month, and in
Sanskrit we find <emph>mâs</emph> for moon, and
<emph>mâsa</emph> for month, both
<pb n='017'/><anchor id='Pg017'/>
masculine.<note place='foot'>See Curtius, Griechische Etymologie, s.
297.</note> Now this <emph>mâs</emph> in Sanskrit is clearly derived
from a root <emph>mâ</emph>, to measure, to mete. In Sanskrit, I
measure is <emph>mâ-mi</emph>; thou measurest,
<emph>mâ-si</emph>; he measures,
<emph>mâ-ti</emph> (or <emph>mimî-te</emph>). An
instrument of measuring is called in Sanskrit <emph>mâ-tram</emph>,
the Greek <emph>metron</emph>, our
metre. Now if the moon was originally called by the
farmer the measurer, the ruler of days, and weeks, and
seasons, the regulator of the tides, the lord of their
festivals, and the herald of their public assemblies, it
is but natural that he should have been conceived as a
man, and not as the love-sick maiden which our modern
sentimental poetry has put in his place.
</p>

<p>
It was the sailor who, before intrusting his life and
goods to the winds and the waves of the ocean, watched
for the rising of those stars which he called the Sailing-stars
or <hi rend='italic'>Pleiades</hi>, from <emph>plein</emph>, to sail.
Navigation in the Greek waters was considered safe after the return of
the Pleiades; and it closed when they disappeared.
The Latin name for the <hi rend='italic'>Pleiades</hi> is
<emph>Vergiliæ</emph>, from
<emph>virga</emph>, a sprout or twig. This name was given to
them by the Italian husbandman, because in Italy,
where they became visible about May, they marked
the return of summer.<note place='foot'>Ideler, Handbuch der
Chronologie, b. i. s. 241, 242.</note> Another constellation, the
seven stars in the head of Taurus, received the name
of <hi rend='italic'>Hyades</hi> or <emph>Pluviæ</emph>
in Latin, because at the time
when they rose with the sun they were supposed to
announce rain. The astronomer retains these and
many other names; he still speaks of the pole of
heaven, of wandering and fixed stars,<note place='foot'>As early
as the times of Anaximenes of the Ionic, and Alcmæon of the
Pythagorean, schools, the stars had been divided into travelling (ἄστρα
πλανώμενα or πλανητά), and non-travelling stars (ἀπλανεῖς ἀστέρες, or
ἀπλανῆ ἄστρα). Aristotle first used ἄστρα ἐνδεδεμένα, or fixed stars. (See
Humboldt, Cosmos, vol. iii. p. 28.) Πόλος, the pivot, hinge, or the pole of
the heaven.</note> but he is apt
<pb n='018'/><anchor id='Pg018'/>
to forget that these terms were not the result of scientific
observation and classification, but were borrowed
from the language of those who themselves were wanderers
on the sea or in the desert, and to whom the
fixed stars were in full reality what their name implies,
stars driven in and fixed, by which they might hold
fast on the deep, as by heavenly anchors.
</p>

<p>
But although historically we are justified in saying
that the first geometrician was a ploughman, the first
botanist a gardener, the first mineralogist a miner, it
may reasonably be objected that in this early stage a
science is hardly a science yet: that measuring a field
is not geometry, that growing cabbages is very far
from botany, and that a butcher has no claim to the
title of comparative anatomist. This is perfectly true,
yet it is but right that each science should be reminded
of these its more humble beginnings, and of the practical
requirements which it was originally intended to
answer. A science, as Bacon says, should be a rich
storehouse for the glory of God, and the relief of
man's estate. Now, although it may seem as if in
the present high state of our society students were
enabled to devote their time to the investigation of
the facts and laws of nature, or to the contemplation
of the mysteries of the world of thought, without any
side-glance at the practical result of their labors, no
science and no art have long prospered and flourished
among us, unless they were in some way subservient
to the practical interests of society. It is true that a
<pb n='019'/><anchor id='Pg019'/>
Lyell collects and arranges, a Faraday weighs and
analyzes, an Owen dissects and compares, a Herschel
observes and calculates, without any thought of the
immediate marketable results of their labors. But
there is a general interest which supports and enlivens
their researches, and that interest depends on the practical
advantages which society at large derives from
their scientific studies. Let it be known that the successive
strata of the geologist are a deception to the
miner, that the astronomical tables are useless to the
navigator, that chemistry is nothing but an expensive
amusement, of no use to the manufacturer and the farmer&mdash;and
astronomy, chemistry, and geology would
soon share the fate of alchemy and astrology. As long
as the Egyptian science excited the hopes of the invalid
by mysterious prescriptions (I may observe by the way
that the hieroglyphic signs of our modern prescriptions
have been traced back by Champollion to the real
hieroglyphics of Egypt<note place='foot'>Bunsen's Egypt, vol.
iv. p. 108.</note>)&mdash;and as long as it instigated
the avarice of its patrons by the promise of the
discovery of gold, it enjoyed a liberal support at the
courts of princes, and under the roofs of monasteries.
Though alchemy did not lead to the discovery of gold,
it prepared the way to discoveries more valuable. The
same with astrology. Astrology was not such mere
imposition as it is generally supposed to have been. It
is counted as a science by so sound and sober a scholar
as Melancthon, and even Bacon allows it a place among
the sciences, though admitting that <q>it had better intelligence
and confederacy with the imagination of man
than with his reason.</q> In spite of the strong condemnation
which Luther pronounced against astrology,
<pb n='020'/><anchor id='Pg020'/>
astrology continued to sway the destinies of Europe;
and a hundred years after Luther, the astrologer was the
counsellor of princes and generals, while the founder
of modern astronomy died in poverty and despair. In
our time the very rudiments of astrology are lost and
forgotten.<note place='foot'>According to a writer in
<q>Notes and Queries</q> (2d Series, vol. x. p.
500,) astrology is not so entirely extinct as we suppose. <q>One of our principal
writers,</q> he states, <q>one of our leading barristers, and several members
of the various antiquarian societies, are practised astrologers at this
hour. But no one cares to let his studies be known, so great is the prejudice
that confounds an art requiring the highest education with the jargon
of the gypsy fortune-teller.</q></note> Even real and useful arts, as soon as they
cease to be useful, die away, and their secrets are
sometimes lost beyond the hope of recovery. When
after the Reformation our churches and chapels were
divested of their artistic ornaments, in order to restore,
in outward appearance also, the simplicity and purity
of the Christian church, the colors of the painted windows
began to fade away, and have never regained
their former depth and harmony. The invention of
printing gave the death-blow to the art of ornamental
writing and of miniature-painting employed in the illumination
of manuscripts; and the best artists of the
present day despair of rivalling the minuteness, softness,
and brilliancy combined by the humble manufacturer
of the mediæval missal.
</p>

<p>
I speak somewhat feelingly on the necessity that
every science should answer some practical purpose,
because I am aware that the science of language has
but little to offer to the utilitarian spirit of our age.
It does not profess to help us in learning languages
more expeditiously, nor does it hold out any hope of
ever realizing the dream of one universal language.
<pb n='021'/><anchor id='Pg021'/>
It simply professes to teach what language is, and this
would hardly seem sufficient to secure for a new science
the sympathy and support of the public at large. There
are problems, however, which, though apparently of an
abstruse and merely speculative character, have exercised
a powerful influence for good or evil in the history of
mankind. Men before now have fought for an idea,
and have laid down their lives for a word; and many
of these problems which have agitated the world from
the earliest to our own times, belong properly to the
science of language.
</p>

<p>
Mythology, which was the bane of the ancient world,
is in truth a disease of language. A myth means a
word, but a word which, from being a name or an attribute,
has been allowed to assume a more substantial
existence. Most of the Greek, the Roman, the Indian,
and other heathen gods are nothing but poetical names,
which were gradually allowed to assume a divine personality
never contemplated by their original inventors.
<emph>Eos</emph> was a name of the dawn before she became a goddess,
the wife of <emph>Tithonos</emph>, or the dying day.
<emph>Fatum</emph>,
or fate, meant originally what had been spoken; and
before Fate became a power, even greater than Jupiter,
it meant that which had once been spoken by
Jupiter, and could never be changed,&mdash;not even by
Jupiter himself. <emph>Zeus</emph> originally meant the bright
heaven, in Sanskrit <emph>Dyaus</emph>; and many of the stories
told of him as the supreme god, had a meaning only
as told originally of the bright heaven, whose rays,
like golden rain, descend on the lap of the earth, the
<emph>Danae</emph> of old, kept by her father in the dark prison of
winter. No one doubts that <emph>Luna</emph> was simply a name
of the moon; but so was likewise <emph>Lucina</emph>, both derived
<pb n='022'/><anchor id='Pg022'/>
from <emph>lucere</emph>, to shine.
<emph>Hecate</emph>, too, was an old name of
the moon, the feminine of <emph>Hekatos</emph> and
<emph>Hekatebolos</emph>, the
far-darting sun; and <emph>Pyrrha</emph>, the Eve of the Greeks,
was nothing but a name of the red earth, and in
particular of Thessaly. This mythological disease,
though less virulent in modern languages, is by no
means extinct.
</p>

<p>
During the Middle Ages the controversy between
Nominalism and Realism, which agitated the church
for centuries, and finally prepared the way for the
Reformation, was again, as its very name shows, a
controversy on names, on the nature of language, and
on the relation of words to our conceptions on one
side, and to the realities of the outer world on the
other. Men were called heretics for believing that
words such as <emph>justice</emph> or <emph>truth</emph> expressed only conceptions
of our mind, not real things walking about in
broad daylight.
</p>

<p>
In modern times the science of language has been
called in to settle some of the most perplexing political
and social questions. <q>Nations and languages against
dynasties and treaties,</q> this is what has remodelled,
and will remodel still more, the map of Europe; and
in America comparative philologists have been encouraged
to prove the impossibility of a common origin of
languages and races, in order to justify, by scientific
arguments, the unhallowed theory of slavery. Never
do I remember to have seen science more degraded
than on the title-page of an American publication in
which, among the profiles of the different races of
man, the profile of the ape was made to look more
human than that of the negro.
</p>

<p>
Lastly, the problem of the position of man on the
<pb n='023'/><anchor id='Pg023'/>
threshold between the worlds of matter and spirit has
of late assumed a very marked prominence among
the problems of the physical and mental sciences. It
has absorbed the thoughts of men who, after a long
life spent in collecting, observing, and analyzing, have
brought to its solution qualifications unrivalled in any
previous age; and if we may judge from the greater
warmth displayed in discussions ordinarily conducted
with the calmness of judges and not with the passion
of pleaders, it might seem, after all, as if the great
problems of our being, of the true nobility of our
blood, of our descent from heaven or earth, though
unconnected with anything that is commonly called
practical, have still retained a charm of their own&mdash;a
charm that will never lose its power on the mind,
and on the heart of man. Now, however much the
frontiers of the animal kingdom have been pushed forward,
so that at one time the line of demarcation between
animal and man seemed to depend on a mere
fold in the brain, there is <emph>one</emph> barrier which no one
has yet ventured to touch&mdash;the barrier of language.
Even those philosophers with whom
<emph>penser c'est sentir</emph>,<note place='foot'><q>Man
has two faculties, or two passive powers, the existence of which
is generally acknowledged; 1, the faculty of receiving the different impressions
caused by external objects, physical sensibility; and 2, the faculty
of preserving the impressions caused by these objects, called memory, or
weakened sensation. These faculties, the productive causes of thought,
we have in common with beasts.... Everything is reducible to
feeling.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Helvetius</hi>.</note>
who reduce all thought to feeling, and maintain that
we share the faculties which are the productive causes
of thought in common with beasts, are bound to confess
that <emph>as yet</emph> no race of animals has produced a language.
Lord Monboddo, for instance, admits that as yet no
<pb n='024'/><anchor id='Pg024'/>
animal has been discovered in the possession of language,
<q>not even the beaver, who of all the animals
we know, that are not, like the orang-outangs, of our
own species, comes nearest to us in sagacity.</q>
</p>

<p>
Locke, who is generally classed together with these
materialistic philosophers, and who certainly vindicated
a large share of what had been claimed for the intellect
as the property of the senses, recognized most fully
the barrier which language, as such, placed between
man and brutes. <q>This I may be positive in,</q> he
writes, <q>that the power of abstracting is not at all
in brutes, and that the having of general ideas is
that which puts a perfect distinction between man
and brutes. For it is evident we observe no footsteps
in these of making use of general signs for universal
ideas; from which we have reason to imagine that
they have not the faculty of abstracting or making
general ideas, since they have no use of <emph>words</emph> or any
other general signs.</q>
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, the science of language gives us an
insight into that which, by common consent, distinguishes
man from all other living beings; if it establishes
a frontier between man and the brute, which
can never be removed, it would seem to possess at
the present moment peculiar claims on the attention
of all who, while watching with sincere admiration
the progress of comparative physiology, yet consider
it their duty to enter their manly protest against a
revival of the shallow theories of Lord Monboddo.
</p>

<p>
But to return to our survey of the history of the
physical sciences. We had examined the empirical
stage through which every science has to pass. We
saw that, for instance, in botany, a man who has
<pb n='025'/><anchor id='Pg025'/>
travelled through distant countries, who has collected
a vast number of plants, who knows their names,
their peculiarities, and their medicinal qualities, is
not yet a botanist, but only a herbalist, a lover of
plants, or what the Italians call a
<emph>dilettante</emph>, from
<emph>dilettare</emph>,
to delight. The real science of plants, like
every other science, begins with the work of classification.
An empirical acquaintance with facts rises
to a scientific knowledge of facts as soon as the mind
discovers beneath the multiplicity of single productions
the unity of an organic system. This discovery is
made by means of comparison and classification. We
cease to study each flower for its own sake; and by
continually enlarging the sphere of our observation,
we try to discover what is common to many and
offers those essential points on which groups or natural
classes may be established. These classes again,
in their more general features, are mutually compared;
new points of difference, or of similarity of a
more general and higher character, spring to view, and
enable us to discover classes of classes, or families.
And when the whole kingdom of plants has thus
been surveyed, and a simple tissue of names been
thrown over the garden of nature; when we can
lift it up, as it were, and view it in our mind as a
whole, as a system well defined and complete, we then
speak of the science of plants, or botany. We have
entered into altogether a new sphere of knowledge
where the individual is subject to the general, fact to
law; we discover thought, order, and purpose pervading
the whole realm of nature, and we perceive
the dark chaos of matter lighted up by the reflection
of a divine mind. Such views may be right or wrong.
<pb n='026'/><anchor id='Pg026'/>
Too hasty comparisons, or too narrow distinctions, may
have prevented the eye of the observer from discovering
the broad outlines of nature's plan. Yet every system,
however insufficient it may prove hereafter, is a step in
advance. If the mind of man is once impressed with
the conviction that there must be order and law everywhere,
it never rests again until all that seems irregular
has been eliminated, until the full beauty and harmony
of nature has been perceived, and the eye of man has
caught the eye of God beaming out from the midst of
all His works. The failures of the past prepare the
triumphs of the future.
</p>

<p>
Thus, to recur to our former illustration, the systematic
arrangement of plants which bears the name
of Linnæus, and which is founded on the number
and character of the reproductive organs, failed to
bring out the natural order which pervades all that
grows and blossoms. Broad lines of demarcation
which unite or divide large tribes and families of
plants were invisible from his point of view. But in
spite of this, his work was not in vain. The fact that
plants in every part of the world belonged to one great
system was established once for all; and even in later
systems most of his classes and divisions have been preserved,
because the conformation of the reproductive
organs of plants happened to run parallel with other
more characteristic marks of true affinity.<note place='foot'><q>The
generative organs being those which are most remotely related
to the habits and food of an animal, I have always regarded as affording
very clear indications of its true affinities.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Owen,
as quoted by Darwin,
Origin of Species</hi>, p. 414.</note> It is the
same in the history of astronomy. Although the Ptolemæan
system was a wrong one, yet even from its eccentric
<pb n='027'/><anchor id='Pg027'/>
point of view, laws were discovered determining
the true movements of the heavenly bodies. The
conviction that there remains something unexplained is
sure to lead to the discovery of our error. There can
be no error in nature; the error must be with us.
This conviction lived in the heart of Aristotle when,
in spite of his imperfect knowledge of nature, he declared
<q>that there is in nature nothing interpolated or
without connection, as in a bad tragedy;</q> and from
his time forward every new fact and every new system
have confirmed his faith.
</p>

<p>
The object of classification is clear. We understand
things if we can comprehend them; that is to say, if
we can grasp and hold together single facts, connect
isolated impressions, distinguish between what is essential
and what is merely accidental, and thus predicate
the general of the individual, and class the individual
under the general. This is the secret of all scientific
knowledge. Many sciences, while passing through this
second or classificatory stage, assume the title of comparative.
When the anatomist has finished the dissection
of numerous bodies, when he has given names to
each organ, and discovered the distinctive functions of
each, he is led to perceive similarity where at first he
saw dissimilarity only. He discovers in the lower animals
rudimentary indications of the more perfect organization
of the higher; and he becomes impressed with
the conviction that there is in the animal kingdom the
same order and purpose which pervades the endless
variety of plants or any other realm of nature. He
learns, if he did not know it before, that things were
not created at random or in a lump, but that there is
a scale which leads, by imperceptible degrees, from the
<pb n='028'/><anchor id='Pg028'/>
lowest infusoria to the crowning work of nature,&mdash;man;
that all is the manifestation of one and the same
unbroken chain of creative thought, the work of one
and the same all-wise Creator.
</p>

<p>
In this way the second or classificatory leads us
naturally to the third or final stage&mdash;the theoretical,
or metaphysical. If the work of classification is properly
carried out, it teaches us that nothing exists in
nature by accident; that each individual belongs to
a species, each species to a genus; and that there are
laws which underlie the apparent freedom and variety
of all created things. These laws indicate to us the
presence of a purpose in the mind of the Creator; and
whereas the material world was looked upon by ancient
philosophers as a mere illusion, as an agglomerate of
atoms, or as the work of an evil principle, we now read
and interpret its pages as the revelation of a divine
power, and wisdom, and love. This has given to the
study of nature a new character. After the observer
has collected his facts, and after the classifier has placed
them in order, the student asks what is the origin and
what is the meaning of all this? and he tries to soar,
by means of induction, or sometimes even of divination,
into regions not accessible to the mere collector.
In this attempt the mind of man no doubt has frequently
met with the fate of Phaeton; but, undismayed
by failure, he asks again and again for his
father's steeds. It has been said that this so-called
philosophy of nature has never achieved anything;
that it has done nothing but prove that things must
be exactly as they had been found to be by the observer
and collector. Physical science, however, would
never have been what it is without the impulses which
<pb n='029'/><anchor id='Pg029'/>
it received from the philosopher, nay even from the
poet. <q>At the limits of exact knowledge</q> (I quote
the words of Humboldt), <q>as from a lofty island-shore,
the eye loves to glance towards distant regions. The
images which it sees may be illusive; but, like the
illusive images which people imagined they had seen
from the Canaries or the Azores, long before the time
of Columbus, they may lead to the discovery of a new
world.</q>
</p>

<p>
Copernicus, in the dedication of his work to Pope
Paul III. (it was commenced in 1517, finished 1530,
published 1543), confesses that he was brought to the
discovery of the sun's central position, and of the diurnal
motion of the earth, not by observation or analysis,
but by what he calls the feeling of a want of symmetry
in the Ptolemaic system. But who had told him that
there <emph>must</emph> be symmetry in all the movements of the
celestial bodies, or that complication was not more
sublime than simplicity? Symmetry and simplicity,
before they were discovered by the observer, were
postulated by the philosopher. The first idea of revolutionizing
the heavens was suggested to Copernicus,
as he tells us himself, by an ancient Greek philosopher,
by Philolaus, the Pythagorean. No doubt with
Philolaus the motion of the earth was only a guess, or,
if you like, a happy intuition. Nevertheless, if we
may trust the words of Copernicus, it is quite possible
that without that guess we should never have heard of
the Copernican system. Truth is not found by addition
and multiplication only. When speaking of Kepler,
whose method of reasoning has been considered as
unsafe and fantastic by his contemporaries as well as by
later astronomers, Sir David Brewster remarks very
<pb n='030'/><anchor id='Pg030'/>
truly, <q>that, as an instrument of research, the influence
of imagination has been much overlooked by those
who have ventured to give laws to philosophy.</q> The
torch of imagination is as necessary to him who looks
for truth, as the lamp of study. Kepler held both, and
more than that, he had the star of faith to guide him
in all things from darkness to light.
</p>

<p>
In the history of the physical sciences, the three
stages which we have just described as the empirical,
the classificatory, and the theoretical, appear
generally in chronological order. I say, generally,
for there have been instances, as in the case just
quoted of Philolaus, where the results properly belonging
to the third have been anticipated in the
first stage. To the quick eye of genius one case may
be like a thousand, and one experiment, well chosen,
may lead to the discovery of an absolute law. Besides,
there are great chasms in the history of science.
The tradition of generations is broken by political or
ethnic earthquakes, and the work that was nearly finished
has frequently had to be done again from the
beginning, when a new surface had been formed for
the growth of a new civilization. The succession,
however, of these three stages is no doubt the natural
one, and it is very properly observed in the study of
every science. The student of botany begins as a
collector of plants. Taking each plant by itself, he
observes its peculiar character, its habitat, its proper
season, its popular or unscientific name. He learns to
distinguish between the roots, the stem, the leaves, the
flower, the calyx, the stamina, and pistils. He learns,
so to say, the practical grammar of the plant before
he can begin to compare, to arrange, and classify.
</p>

<pb n='031'/><anchor id='Pg031'/>

<p>
Again, no one can enter with advantage on the
third stage of any physical science without having
passed through the second. No one can study <emph>the</emph>
plant, no one can understand the bearing of such a
work as, for instance, Professor Schleiden's <q>Life of
the Plant,</q><note place='foot'>Die Pflanze und ihr Leben,
von M. T. Schleiden. Leipzig, 1858.</note> who has not studied the life of plants in
the wonderful variety, and in the still more wonderful
order, of nature. These last and highest achievements
of inductive philosophy are possible only after the
way has been cleared by previous classification. The
philosopher must command his classes like regiments
which obey the order of their general. Thus alone
can the battle be fought and truth be conquered.
</p>

<p>
After this rapid glance at the history of the other
physical sciences, we now return to our own, the science
of language, in order to see whether it really is
a science, and whether it can be brought back to the
standard of the inductive sciences. We want to know
whether it has passed, or is still passing, through the
three phases of physical research; whether its progress
has been systematic or desultory, whether its method
has been appropriate or not. But before we do this, we
shall, I think, have to do something else. You may
have observed that I always took it for granted that
the science of language, which is best known in this
country by the name of comparative philology, is one
of the physical sciences, and that therefore its method
ought to be the same as that which has been followed
with so much success in botany, geology, anatomy,
and other branches of the study of nature. In the
history of the physical sciences, however, we look in
vain for a place assigned to comparative philology, and
<pb n='032'/><anchor id='Pg032'/>
its very name would seem to show that it belongs to
quite a different sphere of human knowledge. There
are two great divisions of human knowledge, which,
according to their subject-matter, are called <emph>physical</emph>
and <emph>historical</emph>. Physical science deals with the works
of God, historical science with the works of man.
Now if we were to judge by its name, comparative
philology, like classical philology, would seem to take
rank, not as a physical, but as an historical science,
and the proper method to be applied to it would be
that which is followed in the history of art, of law,
of politics, and religion. However, the title of comparative
philology must not be allowed to mislead us.
It is difficult to say by whom that title was invented;
but all that can be said in defence of it is, that the
founders of the science of language were chiefly scholars
or philologists, and that they based their inquiries
into the nature and laws of language on a comparison
of as many facts as they could collect within their own
special spheres of study. Neither in Germany, which
may well be called the birthplace of this science, nor
in France, where it has been cultivated with brilliant
success, has that title been adopted. It will not be
difficult to show that, although the science of language
owes much to the classical scholar, and though in return
it has proved of great use to him, yet comparative
philology has really nothing whatever in common
with philology in the usual meaning of the word.
Philology, whether classical or oriental, whether treating
of ancient or modern, of cultivated or barbarous
languages, is an historical science. Language is here
treated simply as a means. The classical scholar uses
Greek or Latin, the oriental scholar Hebrew or Sanskrit,
<pb n='033'/><anchor id='Pg033'/>
or any other language, as a key to an understanding
of the literary monuments which by-gone ages have
bequeathed to us, as a spell to raise from the tomb of
time the thoughts of great men in different ages and
different countries, and as a means ultimately to trace
the social, moral, intellectual, and religious progress of
the human race. In the same manner, if we study
living languages, it is not for their own sake that we
acquire grammars and vocabularies. We do so on
account of their practical usefulness. We use them
as letters of introduction to the best society or to the
best literature of the leading nations of Europe. In
comparative philology the case is totally different. In
the science of language, languages are not treated as
a means; language itself becomes the sole object of
scientific inquiry. Dialects which have never produced
any literature at all, the jargons of savage tribes,
the clicks of the Hottentots, and the vocal modulations
of the Indo-Chinese are as important, nay, for the solution
of some of our problems, more important, than
the poetry of Homer, or the prose of Cicero. We do
not want to know languages, we want to know language;
what language is, how it can form a vehicle
or an organ of thought; we want to know its origin,
its nature, its laws; and it is only in order to arrive
at that knowledge that we collect, arrange, and classify
all the facts of language that are within our reach.
</p>

<p>
And here I must protest, at the very outset of these
lectures, against the supposition that the student of
language must necessarily be a great linguist. I shall
have to speak to you in the course of these lectures of
hundreds of languages, some of which, perhaps, you
may never have heard mentioned even by name. Do
<pb n='034'/><anchor id='Pg034'/>
not suppose that I know these languages as you know
Greek or Latin, French or German. In that sense I
know indeed very few languages, and I never aspired
to the fame of a Mithridates or a Mezzofanti. It is
impossible for a student of language to acquire a practical
knowledge of all tongues with which he has to
deal. He does not wish to speak the Kachikal language,
of which a professorship was lately founded in
the University of Guatemala,<note place='foot'>Sir J. Stoddart,
Glossology, p. 22.</note> or to acquire the elegancies
of the idiom of the Tcheremissians; nor is it his
ambition to explore the literature of the Samoyedes, or
the New-Zealanders. It is the grammar and the dictionary
which form the subject of his inquiries. These
he consults and subjects to a careful analysis, but he
does not encumber his memory with paradigms of
nouns and verbs, or with long lists of words which
have never been used in any work of literature. It is
true, no doubt, that no language will unveil the whole
of its wonderful structure except to the scholar who
has studied it thoroughly and critically in a number
of literary works representing the various periods of
its growth. Nevertheless, short lists of vocables, and
imperfect sketches of a grammar, are in many instances
all that the student can expect to obtain, or
can hope to master and to use for the purposes he has
in view. He must learn to make the best of this fragmentary
information, like the comparative anatomist,
who frequently learns his lessons from the smallest
fragments of fossil bones, or the vague pictures of
animals brought home by unscientific travellers. If it
were necessary for the comparative philologist to acquire
a critical or practical acquaintance with all the
<pb n='035'/><anchor id='Pg035'/>
languages which form the subject of his inquiries, the
science of language would simply be an impossibility.
But we do not expect the botanist to be an experienced
gardener, or the geologist a miner, or the ichthyologist
a practical fisherman. Nor would it be reasonable to
object in the science of language to the same division
of labor which is necessary for the successful cultivation
of subjects much less comprehensive. Though
much of what we might call the realm of language is
lost to us forever, though whole periods in the history
of language are by necessity withdrawn from our
observation, yet the mass of human speech that lies
before us, whether in the petrified strata of ancient
literature or in the countless variety of living languages
and dialects, offers a field as large, if not larger,
than any other branch of physical research. It is
impossible to fix the exact number of known languages,
but their number can hardly be less than nine hundred.
That this vast field should never have excited
the curiosity of the natural philosopher before the
beginning of our century may seem surprising, more
surprising even than the indifference with which former
generations treated the lessons which even the
stones seemed to teach of the life still throbbing in the
veins and on the very surface of the earth. The saying
that "familiarity breeds contempt" would seem
applicable to the subjects of both these sciences. The
gravel of our walks hardly seemed to deserve a scientific
treatment, and the language which every plough-boy
can speak could not be raised without an effort to
the dignity of a scientific problem. Man had studied
every part of nature, the mineral treasures in the
bowels of the earth, the flowers of each season, the
<pb n='036'/><anchor id='Pg036'/>
animals of every continent, the laws of storms, and
the movements of the heavenly bodies; he had analyzed
every substance, dissected every organism, he
knew every bone and muscle, every nerve and fibre of
his own body to the ultimate elements which compose
his flesh and blood; he had meditated on the nature of
his soul, on the laws of his mind, and tried to penetrate
into the last causes of all being&mdash;and yet language,
without the aid of which not even the first step
in this glorious career could have been made, remained
unnoticed. Like a veil that hung too close over the
eye of the human mind, it was hardly perceived. In
an age when the study of antiquity attracted the most
energetic minds, when the ashes of Pompeii were
sifted for the playthings of Roman life; when parchments
were made to disclose, by chemical means, the
erased thoughts of Grecian thinkers; when the tombs
of Egypt were ransacked for their sacred contents, and
the palaces of Babylon and Nineveh forced to surrender
the clay diaries of Nebuchadnezzar; when everything,
in fact, that seemed to contain a vestige of the
early life of man was anxiously searched for and carefully
preserved in our libraries and museums,&mdash;language,
which in itself carries us back far beyond the
cuneiform literature of Assyria and Babylonia, and the
hieroglyphic documents of Egypt; which connects ourselves,
through an unbroken chain of speech, with the
very ancestors of our race, and still draws its life from
the first utterances of the human mind,&mdash;language,
the living and speaking witness of the whole history
of our race, was never cross-examined by the student
of history, was never made to disclose its secrets until
questioned and, so to say, brought back to itself within
<pb n='037'/><anchor id='Pg037'/>
the last fifty years, by the genius of a Humboldt,
Bopp, Grimm, Bunsen, and others. If you consider
that, whatever view we take of the origin and dispersion
of language, nothing new has ever been added to
the substance of language, that all its changes have
been changes of form, that no new root or radical has
ever been invented by later generations, as little as one
single element has ever been added to the material
world in which we live; if you bear in mind that in
one sense, and in a very just sense, we may be said to
handle the very words which issued from the mouth of
the son of God, when he gave names to <q>all cattle,
and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the
field,</q> you will see, I believe, that the science of language
has claims on your attention, such as few
sciences can rival or excel.
</p>

<p>
Having thus explained the manner in which I intend
to treat the science of language, I hope in my
next lecture to examine the objections of those philosophers
who see in language nothing but a contrivance
devised by human skill for the more expeditious
communication of our thoughts, and who would wish
to see it treated, not as a production of nature, but
as a work of human art.

<head>Lecture II. The Growth Of Language In Contradistinction To
The History Of Language.</head>

<p>
In claiming for the science of language a place
among the physical sciences, I was prepared to meet
with many objections. The circle of the physical
sciences seemed closed, and it was not likely that a
new claimant should at once be welcomed among the
established branches and scions of the ancient aristocracy
of learning.<note place='foot'>Dr. Whewell classes the science
of language as one of the palaitiological
sciences; but he makes a distinction between palaitiological sciences
treating of material things, for instance, geology, and others respecting
the products which result from man's imaginative and social endowments,
for instance, comparative philology. He excludes the latter from the circle
of the physical sciences, properly so called, but he adds: <q>We began
our inquiry with the trust that any sound views which we should be able
to obtain respecting the nature of truth in the physical sciences, and the
mode of discovering it, must also tend to throw light upon the nature and
prospects of knowledge of all other kinds;&mdash;must be useful to us in moral,
political, and philological researches. We stated this as a confident anticipation;
and the evidence of the justice of our belief already begins to appear.
We have seen that biology leads us to psychology, if we choose to
follow the path; and thus the passage from the material to the immaterial
has already unfolded itself at one point; and we now perceive that there
are several large provinces of speculation which concern subjects belonging
to man's immaterial nature, and which are governed by the same laws
as sciences altogether physical. It is not our business to dwell on the
prospects which our philosophy thus opens to our contemplation; but we
may allow ourselves, in this last stage of our pilgrimage among the
foundations of the physical sciences, to be cheered and animated by the
ray that thus beams upon us, however dimly, from a higher and brighter
region.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Indications of the Creator</hi>, p. 146.</note>

<p>
The first objection which was sure to be raised on
the part of such sciences as botany, geology, or physiology
is this:&mdash;Language is the work of man; it
was invented by man as a means of communicating
his thoughts, when mere looks and gestures proved
inefficient; and it was gradually, by the combined
efforts of succeeding generations, brought to that perfection
which we admire in the idiom of the Bible, the
Vedas, the Koran, and in the poetry of Homer, Virgil,
Dante, and Shakespeare. Now it is perfectly true that
if language be the work of man, in the same sense in
which a statue, or a temple, or a poem, or a law are
properly called the works of man, the science of language
would have to be classed as an historical science.
We should have a history of language as we have a
history of art, of poetry, and of jurisprudence, but we
could not claim for it a place side by side with the
various branches of Natural History. It is true, also,
that if you consult the works of the most distinguished
modern philosophers you will find that whenever they
speak of language, they take it for granted that language
is a human invention, that words are artificial
signs, and that the varieties of human speech arose
from different nations agreeing on different sounds as
the most appropriate signs of their different ideas.
This view of the origin of language was so powerfully
advocated by the leading philosophers of the last
century, that it has retained an undisputed currency
even among those who, on almost every other point,
are strongly opposed to the teaching of that school.
A few voices, indeed, have been raised to protest
against the theory of language being originally invented
by man. But they, in their zeal to vindicate
<pb n='040'/><anchor id='Pg040'/>
the divine origin of language, seem to have been carried
away so far as to run counter to the express
statements of the Bible. For in the Bible it is not
the Creator who gives names to all things, but
Adam. <q>Out of the ground,</q> we read, <q>the Lord
God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl
of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see
what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam
called every living creature, that was the name
thereof.</q><note place='foot'>Gen. ii. 19.</note>
But with the exception of this small class of
philosophers, more orthodox even than the Bible,<note place='foot'>St.
Basil was accused by Eunomius of denying Divine Providence, because
he would not admit that God had created the names of all things,
but ascribed the invention of language to the faculties which God had implanted
in man. St. Gregory, bishop of Nyssa in Cappadocia (331-396),
defended St. Basil. <q>Though God has given to human nature its faculties,</q>
he writes, <q>it does not follow that therefore He produces all the actions
which we perform. He has given us the faculty of building a house
and doing any other work; but we surely are the builders, and not He. In
the same manner our faculty of speaking is the work of Him who has so
framed our nature; but the invention of words for naming each object is
the work of our mind.</q> See Ladevi-Roche, De l'Origine du Langage:
Bordeaux, 1860, p. 14. Also, Horne Tooke, Diversions of Purley, p. 19.</note>
the generally received opinion on the origin of language
is that which was held by <hi rend='italic'>Locke</hi>, which was
powerfully advocated by <hi rend='italic'>Adam Smith</hi> in his Essay on
the Origin of Language, appended to his Treatise on
Moral Sentiments, and which was adopted with slight
modifications by <hi rend='italic'>Dugald Stewart</hi>. According to them,
man must have lived for a time in a state of mutism,
his only means of communication consisting in gestures
of the body, and in the changes of countenance,
till at last, when ideas multiplied that could no longer
be pointed at with the fingers, <q>they found it necessary
to invent artificial signs of which the meaning was
<pb n='041'/><anchor id='Pg041'/>
fixed by mutual agreement.</q> We need not dwell on
minor differences of opinion as to the exact process
by which this artificial language is supposed to have
been formed. Adam Smith would wish us to believe
that the first artificial words were <emph>verbs</emph>. Nouns, he
thinks, were of less urgent necessity because things
could be pointed at or imitated, whereas mere actions,
such as are expressed by verbs, could not. He therefore
supposes that when people saw a wolf coming,
they pointed at him, and simply cried out, <q>He
comes.</q> Dugald Stewart, on the contrary, thinks
that the first artificial words were nouns, and that
the verbs were supplied by gesture; that, therefore,
when people saw a wolf coming, they did not cry
<q>He comes,</q> but <q>Wolf, Wolf,</q> leaving the rest to
be imagined.<note place='foot'>D. Stewart, Works, vol. iii. p. 27.</note>
</p>

<p>
But whether the verb or the noun was the first to
be invented is of little importance; nor is it possible
for us, at the very beginning of our inquiry into the
nature of language, to enter upon a minute examination
of a theory which represents language as a work
of human art, and as established by mutual agreement
as a medium of communication. While fully
admitting that if this theory were true, the science
of language would not come within the pale of the
physical sciences, I must content myself for the present
with pointing out that no one has yet explained
how, without language, a discussion on the merits of
each word, such as must necessarily have preceded a
mutual agreement, could have been carried on. But
as it is the object of these lectures to prove that language
is not a work of human art, in the same sense
<pb n='042'/><anchor id='Pg042'/>
as painting, or building, or writing, or printing, I must
ask to be allowed, in this preliminary stage, simply to
enter my protest against a theory, which, though still
taught in the schools, is, nevertheless, I believe, without
a single fact to support its truth.
</p>

<p>
But there are other objections besides this which
would seem to bar the admission of the science of
language to the circle of the physical sciences. Whatever
the origin of language may have been, it has
been remarked with a strong appearance of truth,
that language has a history of its own, like art, like
law, like religion; and that, therefore, the science of
language belongs to the circle of the <emph>historical</emph>, or, as
they used to be called, the <emph>moral</emph>, in contradistinction
to the <emph>physical</emph> sciences. It is a well-known fact,
which recent researches have not shaken, that nature
is incapable of progress or improvement. The flower
which the botanist observes to-day was as perfect
from the beginning. Animals, which are endowed
with what is called an artistic instinct, have never
brought that instinct to a higher degree of perfection.
The hexagonal cells of the bee are not more regular
in the nineteenth century than at any earlier period,
and the gift of song has never, as far as we know,
been brought to a higher perfection by our nightingale
than by the Philomelo of the Greeks. <q>Natural
History,</q> to quote Dr. Whewell's words,<note place='foot'>History of
Inductive Sciences, vol. iii. p. 531.</note> <q>when systematically
treated, excludes all that is historical, for it
classes objects by their permanent and universal properties,
and has nothing to do with the narration of
particular or casual facts.</q> Now, if we consider the
large number of tongues spoken in different parts of
<pb n='043'/><anchor id='Pg043'/>
the world with all their dialectic and provincial varieties,
if we observe the great changes which each
of these tongues has undergone in the course of centuries,
how Latin was changed into Italian, Spanish,
Portuguese, Provençal, French, Wallachian, and Roumansch;
how Latin again, together with Greek, and
the Celtic, the Teutonic, and Slavonic languages, together
likewise with the ancient dialects of India and
Persia, must have sprung from an earlier language, the
mother of the whole Indo-European or Aryan family
of speech; if we see how Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac,
with several minor dialects, are but different impressions
of one and the same common type, and must all
have flowed from the same source, the original language
of the Semitic race; and if we add to these two,
the Aryan and Semitic, at least one more well-established
class of languages, the Turanian, comprising the
dialects of the nomad races scattered over Central and
Northern Asia, the Tungusic, Mongolic, Turkic,<note place='foot'>Names ending
in <hi rend='italic'>ic</hi>, are names of classes as distinct from the names of single
languages.</note> Samoyedic,
and Finnic, all radii from one common centre
of speech:&mdash;if we watch this stream of language rolling
on through centuries in these three mighty arms,
which, before they disappear from our sight in the far
distance, clearly show a convergence towards one common
source: it would seem, indeed, as if there were an
historical life inherent in language, and as if both the
will of man and the power of time could tell, if not on
its substance, at least on its form. And even if the
mere local varieties of speech were not considered sufficient
ground for excluding language from the domain
of natural science, there would still remain the greater
<pb n='044'/><anchor id='Pg044'/>
difficulty of reconciling with the recognized principles
of physical science the historical changes affecting
every one of these varieties. Every part of nature,
whether mineral, plant, or animal, is the same in kind
from the beginning to the end of its existence, whereas
few languages could be recognized as the same after
the lapse of but a thousand years. The language of
Alfred is so different from the English of the present
day that we have to study it in the same manner as
we study Greek and Latin. We can read Milton and
Bacon, Shakespeare and Hooker; we can make out
Wycliffe and Chaucer; but, when we come to the
English of the thirteenth century, we can but guess
its meaning, and we fail even in this with works previous
to the Ormulum and Layamon. The historical
changes of language may be more or less rapid, but
they take place at all times and in all countries. They
have reduced the rich and powerful idiom of the poets
of the Veda to the meagre and impure jargon of the
modern Sepoy. They have transformed the language
of the Zend-Avesta and of the mountain records of
Behistún into that of Firdusi and the modern Persians;
the language of Virgil into that of Dante, the language
of Ulfilas into that of Charlemagne, the language of
Charlemagne into that of Goethe. We have reason
to believe that the same changes take place with even
greater violence and rapidity in the dialects of savage
tribes, although, in the absence of a written literature, it
is extremely difficult to obtain trustworthy information.
But in the few instances where careful observations
have been made on this interesting subject, it has been
found that among the wild and illiterate tribes of Siberia,
Africa, and Siam, two or three generations are
<pb n='045'/><anchor id='Pg045'/>
sufficient to change the whole aspect of their dialects.
The languages of highly civilized nations, on the
contrary, become more and more stationary, and seem
sometimes almost to lose their power of change. Where
there is a classical literature, and where its language is
spread to every town and village, it seems almost impossible
that any further changes should take place.
Nevertheless, the language of Rome, for so many centuries
the queen of the whole civilized world, was deposed
by the modern Romance dialects, and the ancient
Greek was supplanted in the end by the modern Romaic.
And though the art of printing and the wide
diffusion of Bibles, and Prayer-books, and newspapers
have acted as still more powerful barriers to arrest the
constant flow of human speech, we may see that the
language of the authorized version of the Bible, though
perfectly intelligible, is no longer the spoken language
of England. In Booker's Scripture and Prayer-book
Glossary<note place='foot'>Lectures on the English Language, by G. P. Marsh: New York,
1860, p. 263 and 630. These lectures embody the result of much careful research,
and are full of valuable observations.</note> the number of words or senses of words
which have become obsolete since 1611, amount to 388,
or nearly one fifteenth part of the whole number of
words used in the Bible. Smaller changes, changes
of accent and meaning, the reception of new, and the
dropping of old words, we may watch as taking place
under our own eyes. Rogers<note place='foot'>Marsh, p. 532,
<hi rend='italic'>note</hi>.</note> said that <q><emph>cóntemplate</emph>
is bad enough, but <emph>bálcony</emph> makes me sick,</q> whereas at present
no one is startled by <emph>cóntemplate</emph> instead of <emph>contémplate</emph>,
and <emph>bálcony</emph> has become more usual than <emph>balcóny</emph>.
Thus <emph>Roome</emph> and <emph>chaney</emph>, <emph>layloc</emph> and
<emph>goold</emph>, have but lately been driven from the stage by
<emph>Rome</emph>, <emph>china</emph>,
<pb n='046'/><anchor id='Pg046'/>
<emph>lilac</emph>, and <emph>gold</emph>, and some courteous gentlemen of the
old school still continue to be <emph>obleeged</emph> instead of being
<emph>obliged</emph>. <emph>Force</emph>,<note place='foot'>Marsh,
p. 589.</note> in the sense of a waterfall, and <emph>gill</emph>, in
the sense of a rocky ravine, were not used in classical
English before Wordsworth. <emph>Handbook</emph>,<note place='foot'>Sir
J. Stoddart, Glossology, p. 60.</note> though an old
Anglo-Saxon word, has but lately taken the place of
<emph>manual</emph>, and a number of words such as <emph>cab</emph> for cabriolet,
<emph>buss</emph> for omnibus, and even a verb such as <emph>to shunt</emph>
tremble still on the boundary line between the vulgar
and the literary idioms. Though the grammatical
changes that have taken place since the publication
of the authorized version are yet fewer in number,
still we may point out some. The termination of the
third person singular in <emph>th</emph> is now entirely replaced by
<emph>s</emph>. No one now says <emph>he liveth</emph>, but only <emph>he lives</emph>.
Several of the irregular imperfects and participles have assumed
a new form. No one now uses <emph>he spake</emph>, and <emph>he
drave</emph>, instead of <emph>he spoke</emph>, and <emph>he drove</emph>;
<emph>holpen</emph> is replaced
by <emph>helped</emph>; <emph>holden</emph> by <emph>held</emph>; <emph>shapen</emph>
by <emph>shaped</emph>.
The distinction between <emph>ye</emph> and <emph>you</emph>, the former being
reserved for the nominative, the latter for all the other
cases, is given up in modern English; and what is apparently
a new grammatical form, the possessive pronoun
<emph>its</emph>, has sprung into life since the beginning of the
seventeenth century. It never occurs in the Bible;
and though it is used three or four times by Shakespeare,
Ben Jonson does not recognize it as yet in his
English Grammar.<note place='foot'>Trench, English Past
and Present, p. 114; Marsh, p. 397.</note>
</p>

<p>
It is argued, therefore, that as language, differing
thereby from all other productions of nature, is liable
to historical alterations, it is not fit to be treated in the
<pb n='047'/><anchor id='Pg047'/>
same manner as the subject-matter of all the other
physical sciences.
</p>

<p>
There is something very plausible in this objection,
but if we examine it more carefully, we shall find
that it rests entirely on a confusion of terms. We
must distinguish between historical change and natural
growth. Art, science, philosophy, and religion all have
a history; language, or any other production of nature,
admits only of growth.
</p>

<p>
Let us consider, first, that although there is a continuous
change in language, it is not in the power of
man either to produce or to prevent it. We might
think as well of changing the laws which control the
circulation of our blood, or of adding an inch to our
height, as of altering the laws of speech, or inventing
new words according to our own pleasure. As man is
the lord of nature only if he knows her laws and submits
to them, the poet and the philosopher become the lords
of language only if they know its laws and obey them.
</p>

<p>
When the Emperor Tiberius had made a mistake,
and was reproved for it by Marcellus, another grammarian
of the name of Capito, who happened to be present,
remarked that what the emperor said was good
Latin, or, if it were not, it would soon be so. Marcellus,
more of a grammarian than a courtier, replied,
<q>Capito is a liar; for, Cæsar, thou canst give the
Roman citizenship to men, but not to words.</q> A similar
anecdote is told of the German Emperor Sigismund.
When presiding at the Council of Costnitz,
he addressed the assembly in a Latin speech, exhorting
them to eradicate the schism of the Hussites.
<q>Videte Patres,</q> he said, <q>ut eradicetis schismam
Hussitarum.</q> He was very unceremoniously called
<pb n='048'/><anchor id='Pg048'/>
to order by a monk, who called out, <q>Serenissime Rex,
schisma est generis neutri.</q><note place='foot'>As several
of my reviewers have found fault with the monk for using
the genitive <emph>neutri</emph>, instead of
<emph>neutrius</emph>, I beg to refer to Priscianus, 1. vi.
c. i. and c. vii. The expression
<emph>generis neutrius</emph>, though frequently used by
modern editors, has no authority, I believe, in ancient
Latin.</note> The emperor, however,
without losing his presence of mind, asked the impertinent
monk, <q>How do you know it?</q> The old
Bohemian school-master replied, <q>Alexander Gallus
says so.</q> <q>And who is Alexander Gallus?</q> the emperor
rejoined. The monk replied, <q>He was a monk.</q>
<q>Well,</q> said the emperor, <q>and I am Emperor of
Rome; and my word, I trust, will be as good as the
word of any monk.</q> No doubt the laughers were
with the emperor; but for all that,
<emph>schisma</emph> remained
a neuter, and not even an emperor could change its
gender or termination.
</p>

<p>
The idea that language can be changed and improved
by man is by no means a new one. We know
that Protagoras, an ancient Greek philosopher, after
laying down some laws on gender, actually began to find
fault with the text of Homer, because it did not agree
with his rules. But here, as in every other instance,
the attempt proved unavailing. Try to alter the smallest
rule of English, and you will find that it is physically
impossible. There is apparently a very small
difference between <emph>much</emph> and <emph>very</emph>, but you can hardly
ever put one in the place of the other. You can say,
<q>I am very happy,</q> but not <q>I am much happy,</q>
though you may say <q>I am most happy.</q> On the
contrary, you can say <q>I am much misunderstood,</q>
but not <q>I am very misunderstood.</q> Thus the western
Romance dialects, Spanish and Portuguese, together
<pb n='049'/><anchor id='Pg049'/>
with Wallachian, can only employ the Latin
word <emph>magis</emph> for forming
comparatives:&mdash;Sp. <emph>mas
dulce</emph>; Port. <emph>mais doce</emph>;
Wall, <emph>mai dulce</emph>; while
French, Provençal, and Italian only allow <emph>of plus</emph> for
the same purpose: Ital. <emph>più dolce</emph>;
Prov. <emph>plus dous</emph>;
Fr. <emph>plus doux</emph>.
It is by no means impossible, however,
that this distinction between <emph>very</emph>, which is now used
with adjectives only, and <emph>much</emph>, which precedes participles,
should disappear in time. In fact, <q>very pleased</q>
and <q>very delighted</q> are Americanisms which may
be heard even in this country. But if that change
take place, it will not be by the will of any individual,
nor by the mutual agreement of any large number of
men, but rather in spite of the exertions of grammarians
and academies. And here you perceive the first
difference between history and growth. An emperor
may change the laws of society, the forms of religion,
the rules of art: it is in the power of one generation,
or even of one individual, to raise an art to the highest
pitch of perfection, while the next may allow it to
lapse, till a new genius takes it up again with renewed
ardor. In all this we have to deal with the conscious
acts of individuals, and we therefore move on historical
ground. If we compare the creations of Michael Angelo
or Raphael with the statues and frescoes of ancient
Rome, we can speak of a history of art. We can
connect two periods separated by thousands of years
through the works of those who handed on the traditions
of art from century to century; but we shall
never meet with that continuous and unconscious
growth which connects the language of Plautus with
that of Dante. The process through which language
is settled and unsettled combines in one the two opposite
<pb n='050'/><anchor id='Pg050'/>
elements of necessity and free will. Though the
individual seems to be the prime agent in producing
new words and new grammatical forms, he is so only
after his individuality has been merged in the common
action of the family, tribe, or nation to which he belongs.
He can do nothing by himself, and the first
impulse to a new formation in language, though given
by an individual, is mostly, if not always, given without
premeditation, nay, unconsciously. The individual,
as such, is powerless, and the results apparently
produced by him depend on laws beyond his control,
and on the co-operation of all those who form together
with him one class, one body, or one organic whole.
</p>

<p>
But, though it is easy to show, as we have just done,
that language cannot be changed or moulded by the
taste, the fancy, or genius of man, it is very difficult to
explain what causes the growth of language. Ever
since Horace it has been usual to compare the growth of
languages with the growth of trees. But comparisons
are treacherous things. What do we know of the real
causes of the growth of a tree, and what can we gain
by comparing things which we do not quite understand
with things which we understand even less? Many
people speak, for instance, of the terminations of the
verb, as if they sprouted out from the root as from
their parent stock.<note place='foot'>Castelvetro, in
Horne Tooke, p. 629, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi>.</note> But what ideas can they connect
with such expressions? If we must compare language
with a tree, there is one point which may be illustrated
by this comparison, and this is that neither language
nor the tree can exist or grow by itself. Without the
soil, without air and light, the tree could not live; it
could not even be conceived to live. It is the same
<pb n='051'/><anchor id='Pg051'/>
with language. Language cannot exist by itself; it
requires a soil on which to grow, and that soil is the
human soul. To speak of language as a thing by itself,
as living a life of its own, as growing to maturity,
producing offspring, and dying away, is sheer mythology;
and though we cannot help using metaphorical
expressions, we should always be on our guard, when
engaged in inquiries like the present, against being
carried away by the very words which we are using.
</p>

<p>
Now, what we call the growth of language comprises
two processes which should be carefully distinguished,
though they may be at work simultaneously. These
two processes I call,
</p>

<p>
1. <hi rend='italic'>Dialectical Regeneration.</hi>
</p>

<p>
2. <hi rend='italic'>Phonetic Decay.</hi>
</p>

<p>
I begin with the second, as the more obvious, though
in reality its operations are mostly subsequent to the
operations of dialectical regeneration. I must ask you
at present to take it for granted that everything in
language had originally a meaning. As language can
have no other object but to express our meaning, it
might seem to follow almost by necessity that language
should contain neither more nor less than what is required
for that purpose. It would also seem to follow
that if language contains no more than what is necessary
for conveying a certain meaning, it would be
impossible to modify any part of it without defeating
its very purpose. This is really the case in some languages.
In Chinese, for instance, <emph>ten</emph> is expressed by
<emph>shĭ</emph>. It would be impossible to change
<emph>shĭ</emph> in the slightest
way without making it unfit to express <emph>ten</emph>. If
instead of <emph>shĭ</emph>
we pronounced <emph>t'sĭ</emph>, this would mean
<emph>seven</emph>, but not <emph>ten</emph>. But now, suppose we wished to
<pb n='052'/><anchor id='Pg052'/>
express double the quantity of ten, twice ten, or twenty.
We should in Chinese take <emph>eúl</emph>, which is two,
put it before <emph>shĭ</emph>, and say
<emph>eúl-shĭ</emph>, twenty. The same caution
which applied to <emph>shĭ</emph>, applies again to
<emph>eúl-shĭ</emph>. As soon
as you change it, by adding or dropping a single letter,
it is no longer twenty, but either something else or
nothing. We find exactly the same in other languages
which, like Chinese, are called monosyllabic. In
Tibetan, <emph>chu</emph> is ten,
<emph>nyi</emph> two;
<emph>nyi-chu</emph>, twenty. In
Burmese <emph>she</emph> is ten,
<emph>nhit</emph> two;
<emph>nhit-she</emph>, twenty.
</p>

<p>
But how is it in English, or in Gothic, or in Greek
and Latin, or in Sanskrit? We do not say <emph>two-ten</emph> in
English, nor <emph>duo-decem</emph>
in Latin, nor <emph>dvi-da'sa</emph> in Sanskrit.
</p>

<lg>
<l>We find<note place='foot'>Bopp, Comparative Grammar, § 320.
Schleicher, Deutsche Sprache, s.
233.</note> in Sanskrit <emph>vin'sati</emph>.</l>
<l>in Greek <emph>eikati</emph>.</l>
<l>in Latin <emph>viginti</emph>.</l>
<l>in English <emph>twenty</emph>.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Now here we see, first, that the Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin, are only local modifications of one and the same
original word; whereas the English <emph>twenty</emph> is a new
compound, the Gothic <emph>tvai tigjus</emph> (two decads), the
Anglo-Saxon <emph>tuêntig</emph>, framed from Teutonic materials;
a product, as we shall see, of Dialectical Regeneration.
</p>

<p>
We next observe that the first part of the Latin
<emph>viginti</emph> and of the Sanskrit
<emph>vin'sati</emph> contains the same
number, which from <emph>dvi</emph> has been
reduced to <emph>vi</emph>. This
is not very extraordinary; for the Latin
<emph>bis</emph>, twice,
which you still hear at our concerts, likewise stands
for an original <emph>dvis</emph>, the English
<emph>twice</emph>, the Greek <emph>dis</emph>.
This <emph>dis</emph>
appears again as a Latin preposition, meaning
<emph>a-two</emph>; so that, for instance, <emph>discussion</emph> means, originally,
<pb n='053'/><anchor id='Pg053'/>
striking a-two, different from <emph>percussion</emph>, which
means striking through and through. <emph>Discussion</emph> is,
in fact, the cracking of a nut in order to get at its
kernel. Well, the same word, <emph>dvi</emph> or
<emph>vi</emph>, we have in
the Latin word for twenty, which is <emph>vi-ginti</emph>,
the Sanskrit
<emph>vin-'sati</emph>.
</p>

<p>
It can likewise be proved that the second part of
<emph>viginti</emph>
is a corruption of the old word for ten. Ten,
in Sanskrit, is <emph>da'san</emph>;
from it is derived <emph>da'sati</emph>, a decad;
and this <emph>da'sati</emph> was again reduced
to <emph>'sati</emph>; thus
giving us with <emph>vi</emph> for
<emph>dvi</emph>, two, the Sanskrit
<emph>vi'sati</emph> or
<emph>vin'sati</emph>, twenty.
The Latin <emph>viginti</emph>, the
Greek <emph>eikati</emph>,
owe their origin to the same process.
</p>

<p>
Now consider the immense difference&mdash;I do not
mean in sound, but in character&mdash;between two such
words as the Chinese <emph>eúl-shĭ</emph>,
two-ten, or twenty, and
those mere cripples of words which we meet with
in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin. In Chinese there is
neither too much, nor too little. The word speaks
for itself, and requires no commentary. In Sanskrit,
on the contrary, the most essential parts of the two
component elements are gone, and what remains is a
kind of metamorphic agglomerate which cannot be
understood without a most minute microscopic analysis.
Here, then, you have an instance of what is
meant by <emph>phonetic corruption</emph>; and you will perceive
how, not only the form, but the whole nature of language
is destroyed by it. As soon as phonetic corruption
shows itself in a language, that language has lost
what we considered to be the most essential character
of all human speech, namely, that every part of it
should have a meaning. The people who spoke Sanskrit
were as little aware that
<emph>vin'sati</emph> meant <emph>twice ten</emph>
<pb n='054'/><anchor id='Pg054'/>
as a Frenchman is that <emph>vingt</emph>
contains the remains of
<emph>deux</emph> and <emph>dix</emph>.
Language, therefore, has entered into a
new stage as soon as it submits to the attacks of phonetic
change. The life of language has become benumbed
and extinct in those words or portions of
words which show the first traces of this phonetic
mould. Henceforth those words or portions of words
can be kept up only artificially or by tradition; and,
what is important, a distinction is henceforth established
between what is substantial or radical, and
what is merely formal or grammatical in words.
</p>

<p>
For let us now take another instance, which will
make it clearer, how phonetic corruption leads to the
first appearance of so-called grammatical forms. We
are not in the habit of looking on <emph>twenty</emph> as the plural
or dual of <emph>ten</emph>. But how was a plural originally
formed? In Chinese, which from the first has guarded
most carefully against the taint of phonetic corruption,
the plural is formed in the most sensible manner. Thus,
man in Chinese is <emph>ģin</emph>;
<emph>kiai</emph> means the whole or totality.
This added to <emph>ģin</emph> gives
<emph>ģin-kiai</emph>, which is the
plural of man. There are other words which are
used for the same purpose in Chinese; for instance,
<emph>péi</emph>, which means a class. Hence,
<emph>ĭ</emph>, a stranger, followed
by <emph>péi</emph>, class, gives
<emph>ĭ-péi</emph>, strangers. We have
similar plurals in English, but we do not reckon them
as grammatical forms. Thus, <emph>man-kind</emph> is formed exactly
like <emph>ĭ-péi</emph>, stranger-kind;
<emph>Christendom</emph> is the same
as all Christians, and <emph>clergy</emph> is synonymous
with <emph>clerici</emph>.
The same process is followed in other cognate languages.
In Tibetan the plural is formed by the addition
of such words as <emph>kun</emph>, all, and
<emph>t'sogs</emph>,
multitude.<note place='foot'>Foucaux, Grammaire Tibetaine, p.
27, and Preface, p. x.</note>
<pb n='055'/><anchor id='Pg055'/>
Even the numerals, <emph>nine</emph> and <emph>hundred</emph>, are used for the
same purpose. And here again, as long as these words
are fully understood and kept alive, they resist phonetic
corruption; but the moment they lose, so to say, their
presence of mind, phonetic corruption sets in, and as
soon as phonetic corruption has commenced its ravages,
those portions of a word which it affects retain
a merely artificial or conventional existence, and dwindle
down to grammatical terminations.
</p>

<p>
I am afraid I should tax your patience too much
were I to enter here on an analysis of the grammatical
terminations in Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin, in order to
show how these terminations arose out of independent
words, which were slowly reduced to mere dust by the
constant wear and tear of speech. But in order to
explain how the principle of phonetic decay leads to
the formation of grammatical terminations, let us look
to languages with which we are more familiar. Let us
take the French adverb. We are told by French grammarians<note place='foot'>Fuchs,
Romanische Sprachen, s. 355.</note>
that in order to form adverbs we have to add
the termination <emph>ment</emph>. Thus
from <emph>bon</emph>, good, we form
<emph>bonnement</emph>, from
<emph>vrai</emph>, true,
<emph>vraiment</emph>. This termination
does not exist in Latin. But we meet in Latin<note place='foot'>Quint.,
v. 10, 52. Bonâ mente factum, ideo palam; malâ, ideo ex insidiis.</note> with
expressions such as <emph>bonâ mente</emph>, in good faith.
We read in Ovid, <q>Insistam forti mente,</q> I shall insist
with a strong mind or will, I shall insist strongly; in
French, <q>J'insisterai fortement.</q> Therefore, what
has happened in the growth of Latin, or in the change
of Latin into French, is simply this: in phrases such
as <emph>forti mente</emph>,
the last word was no longer felt as a distinct
<pb n='056'/><anchor id='Pg056'/>
word, and it lost at the same time its distinct pronunciation.
<emph>Mente</emph>, the ablative of
<emph>mens</emph>, was changed
into <emph>ment</emph>,
and was preserved as a merely formal element,
as the termination of adverbs, even in cases
where a recollection of the original meaning of
<emph>mente</emph>
(with a mind), would have rendered its employment
perfectly impossible. If we say in French that a hammer
falls <emph>lourdement</emph>, we little suspect that we
ascribe to a piece of iron a heavy mind. In Italian, though
the adverbial termination <emph>mente</emph> in
<emph>claramente</emph> is no
longer felt as a distinct word, it has not as yet been
affected by phonetic corruption; and in Spanish it is
sometimes used as a distinct word, though even then it
cannot be said to have retained its distinct meaning.
Thus, instead of saying, <q>claramente, concisamente y
elegantemente,</q> it is more elegant to say in Spanish,
<q>clara, concisa y elegante mente.</q>
</p>

<p>
It is difficult to form any conception of the extent
to which the whole surface of a language may be altered
by what we have just described as phonetic
change. Think that in the French <emph>vingt</emph> you have
the same elements as in <emph>deux</emph> and <emph>dix</emph>; that the second
part of the French <emph>douze</emph>, twelve, represents the
Latin <emph>decim</emph> in <emph>duodecim</emph>;
that the final <emph>te</emph> of <emph>trente</emph>
was originally the Latin <emph>ginta</emph> in
<emph>triginta</emph>, which <emph>ginta</emph>
was again a derivation and abbreviation of the Sanskrit
<emph>da'sa</emph> or <emph>da'sati</emph>, ten. Then consider how early this
phonetic disease must have broken out. For in the
same manner as <emph>vingt</emph> in French, <emph>veinte</emph> in Spanish, and
<emph>venti</emph> in Italian presuppose the more primitive <emph>viginti</emph>
which we find in Latin, so this Latin <emph>viginti</emph>, together
with the Greek <emph>eikati</emph>, and the Sanskrit <emph>vin'sati</emph> presuppose
an earlier language from which they are in turn
<pb n='057'/><anchor id='Pg057'/>
derived, and in which, previous to <emph>viginti</emph>, there must
have been a more primitive form <emph>dvi-ginti</emph>, and previous
to this again, another compound as clear and intelligible
as the Chinese <emph>eúl-shĭ</emph>, consisting of the ancient
Aryan names for two, <emph>dvi</emph>, and ten, <emph>da'sati</emph>. Such is
the virulence of this phonetic change, that it will sometimes
eat away the whole body of a word, and leave
nothing behind but decayed fragments. Thus, <emph>sister</emph>,
which in Sanskrit is <emph>svasar</emph>,<note place='foot'>Sanskrit
<emph>s</emph> = Persian <emph>h</emph>; therefore <emph>svasar</emph> =
<emph>hvahar</emph>. This becomes <emph>chohar</emph>,
<emph>chor</emph>, and <emph>cho</emph>. Zend, <emph>qaņha</emph>, acc.
<emph>qaņharem</emph>, Persian, <emph>kháher</emph>. Bopp,
Comp. Gram. § 35.</note> appears in Pehlvi and in
Ossetian as <emph>cho</emph>. <emph>Daughter</emph>,
which in Sanskrit is <emph>duhitar</emph>,
has dwindled down in Bohemian to <emph>dci</emph> (pronounced
<emph>tsi</emph>).<note place='foot'>Schleicher,
Beiträge, b. ii. s. 392: <emph>dci</emph> =
<emph>dŭgti</emph>; gen. <emph>dcere</emph> = <emph>dŭgtere</emph>.</note>
Who would believe that <emph>tear</emph> and <emph>larme</emph> are derived
from the same source; that the French <emph>même</emph>
contains the Latin <emph>semetipsissimus</emph>; that in <emph>aujourd'hui</emph>
we have the Latin word <emph>dies</emph> twice!<note place='foot'><emph>Hui</emph> =
<emph>hodie</emph>, Ital. <emph>oggi</emph> and <emph>oggidi</emph>;
<emph>jour</emph> = <emph>diurnum</emph>, from <emph>dies</emph>.</note> Who would
recognize the Latin <emph>pater</emph> in the Armenian <emph>hayr</emph>? Yet
we make no difficulty about identifying <emph>père</emph> and <emph>pater</emph>;
and as several initial h's in Armenian correspond to an
original <emph>p</emph> (<emph>het</emph> = <emph>pes</emph>,
<emph>pedis</emph>; <emph>hing</emph> = πέντε; <emph>hour</emph> = πῦρ),
it follows that <emph>hayr</emph> is <emph>pater</emph>.<note place='foot'>See
M. M.'s Letter to Chevalier Bunsen, On the Turanian Languages,
p. 67.</note>
</p>

<p>
We are accustomed to call these changes the growth
of language, but it would be more appropriate to call
this process of phonetic change decay, and thus to distinguish
it from the second or dialectical process which
we must now examine, and which involves, as you will
see, a more real principle of growth.
</p>

<p>
In order to understand the meaning of <emph>dialectical
<pb n='058'/><anchor id='Pg058'/>
regeneration</emph> we must first see clearly what we mean by
dialect. We saw before that language has no independent
substantial existence. Language exists in
man, it lives in being spoken, it dies with each word
that is pronounced, and is no longer heard. It is a
mere accident that language should ever have been
reduced to writing, and have been made the vehicle
of a written literature. Even now the largest number
of languages have produced no literature. Among
the numerous tribes of Central Asia, Africa, America,
and Polynesia, language still lives in its natural state,
in a state of continual combustion; and it is there that
we must go if we wish to gain an insight into the
growth of human speech previous to its being arrested
by any literary interference. What we are accustomed
to call languages, the literary idioms of Greece, and
Rome, and India, of Italy, France, and Spain, must
be considered as artificial, rather than as natural forms
of speech. The real and natural life of language is in
its dialects, and in spite of the tyranny exercised by
the classical or literary idioms, the day is still very far
off which is to see the dialects, even of such classical
languages as Italian and French, entirely eradicated.
About twenty of the Italian dialects have been reduced
to writing, and made known by the press.<note place='foot'>See
Marsh, p. 678; Sir John Stoddart's Glossology, s. 31.</note> Champollion-Figeac
reckons the most distinguishable dialects of
France at fourteen.<note place='foot'>Glossology, p. 33.</note>
The number of modern Greek dialects<note place='foot'>Ibid., p. 29.</note>
is carried by some as high as seventy, and
though many of these are hardly more than local varieties,
yet some, like the Tzaconic, differ from the literary
language as much as Doric differed from Attic.
<pb n='059'/><anchor id='Pg059'/>
In the island of Lesbos, villages distant from each other
not more than two or three hours have frequently peculiar
words of their own, and their own peculiar pronunciation.<note place='foot'>Nea
Pandora, 1859, Nos. 227, 229. Zeitschrift für Vergleichende
Sprachforschung, x. s. 190.</note>
But let us take a language which, though not
without a literature, has been less under the influence
of classical writers than Italian or French, and we shall
then see at once how abundant the growth of dialects!
The Friesian, which is spoken on a small area on the
north-western coast of Germany, between the Scheldt
and Jutland, and on the islands near the shore, which
has been spoken there for at least two thousand years,<note place='foot'>Grimm,
Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache, p. 668: Marsh, p. 379.</note>
and which possesses literary documents as old as the
twelfth century, is broken up into endless local dialects.
I quote from Kohl's Travels. <q>The commonest
things,</q> he writes, <q>which are named almost alike
all over Europe, receive quite different names in the
different Friesian Islands. Thus, in Amrum, <emph>father</emph> is
called <emph>aatj</emph>; on the Halligs, <emph>baba</emph>
or <emph>babe</emph>; in Sylt, <emph>foder</emph>
or <emph>vaar</emph>; in many districts on the main-land, <emph>täte</emph>; in
the eastern part of Föhr, <emph>oti</emph> or <emph>ohitj</emph>. Although these
people live within a couple of German miles from each
other, these words differ more than the Italian <emph>padre</emph>
and the English <emph>father</emph>. Even the names of their districts
and islands are totally different in different dialects.
The island of <emph>Sylt</emph> is called <emph>Söl</emph>,
<emph>Sol</emph>, and <emph>Sal</emph>.</q>
Each of these dialects, though it might be made out by
a Friesian scholar, is unintelligible except to the peasants
of each narrow district in which it prevails. What
is therefore generally called the Friesian language, and
described as such in Friesian grammars, is in reality
<pb n='060'/><anchor id='Pg060'/>
but one out of many dialects, though, no doubt, the
most important; and the same holds good with regard
to all so-called literary languages.
</p>

<p>
It is a mistake to imagine that dialects are everywhere
corruptions of the literary language. Even in
England,<note place='foot'><q>Some people, who
may have been taught to consider the Dorset dialect
as having originated from corruption of the written English, may not
be prepared to hear that it is not only a separate offspring from the Anglo-Saxon
tongue, but purer, and in some cases richer, than the dialect which
is chosen as the national speech.</q>&mdash;Barnes,
<hi rend='italic'>Poems in Dorset Dialect</hi>, Preface,
p. xiv.</note> the local patois have many forms which are
more primitive than the language of Shakespeare, and
the richness of their vocabulary surpasses, on many
points, that of the classical writers of any period.
Dialects have always been the feeders rather than
the channels of a literary language; anyhow, they
are parallel streams which existed long before one
of them was raised to that temporary eminence which
is the result of literary cultivation.
</p>

<p>
What Grimm says of the origin of dialects in general
applies only to such as are produced by phonetic corruption.
<q>Dialects,</q> he writes,<note place='foot'>Geschichte
der Deutschen Sprache, s. 833.</note> <q>develop themselves
progressively, and the more we look backward in the
history of language the smaller is their number, and the
less definite their features. All multiplicity arises gradually
from an original unity.</q> So it seems, indeed,
if we build our theories of language exclusively on the
materials supplied by literary idioms, such as Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, and Gothic. No doubt these are the
royal heads in the history of language. But as political
history ought to be more than a chronicle of royal
dynasties, so the historian of language ought never to
<pb n='061'/><anchor id='Pg061'/>
lose sight of those lower and popular strata of speech
from which these dynasties originally sprang, and by
which alone they are supported.
</p>

<p>
Here, however, lies the difficulty. How are we to
trace the history of dialects? In the ancient history
of language, literary dialects alone supply us with materials,
whereas the very existence of spoken dialects is
hardly noticed by ancient writers.
</p>

<p>
We are told, indeed, by Pliny,<note place='foot'>Pliny,
vi. 5; Hervas, Catalogo, i. 118.</note> that in Colchis there
were more than three hundred tribes speaking different
dialects; and that the Romans, in order to carry on
any intercourse with the natives, had to employ a
hundred and thirty interpreters. This is probably an
exaggeration; but we have no reason to doubt the
statement of Strabo,<note place='foot'>Pliny
depends on Timosthenes, whom Strabo declares untrustworthy
(ii. p. 93, ed. Casaub.) Strabo himself says of Dioscurias, συνέρχεσθαι ἐς
αὐτὴν ἐβδομήκοντα, οἱ δὲ καὶ τριακόσια ἔθνη φασίν οἴς οὐδὲν τῶν ὄντων
υέλει (x. p. 498). The last words refer probably to
Timosthenes.</note> who speaks of seventy tribes living
together in that country, which, even now, is
called <q>the mountain of languages.</q> In modern times,
again, when missionaries have devoted themselves to
the study of the languages of savage and illiterate
tribes, they have seldom been able to do more than to
acquire one out of many dialects; and, when their exertions
have been at all successful, that dialect which
they had reduced to writing, and made the medium of
their civilizing influence, soon assumed a kind of literary
supremacy, so as to leave the rest behind as barbarous
jargons. Yet, whatever is known of the dialects
of savage tribes is chiefly or entirely due to missionaries;
and it is much to be desired that their attention
should again and again be directed to this interesting
<pb n='062'/><anchor id='Pg062'/>
problem of the dialectical life of language which they
alone have the means of elucidating. Gabriel Sagard,
who was sent as a missionary to the Hurons in 1626,
and published his <q>Grand Voyage du pays des Hurons,</q>
at Paris, in 1631, states that among these North
American tribes hardly one village speaks the same
language as another; nay, that two families of the
same village do not speak exactly the same language.
And he adds what is important, that their language
is changing every day, and is already so much changed
that the ancient Huron language is almost entirely different
from the present. During the last two hundred
years, on the contrary, the languages of the Hurons
and Iroquois are said not to have changed at
all.<note place='foot'>Du Ponceau, p. 110.</note> We
read of missionaries<note place='foot'>S. F. Waldeck,
Lettre à M. Jomard des environs de Palenqué, Amérique
Centrale. (<q>Il ne pouvait se servir, en 1833, d'un vocabulaire composé
avec beaucoup de soin dix ans auparavant.</q>)</note> in Central America who attempted
to write down the language of savage tribes, and who
compiled with great care a dictionary of all the words
they could lay hold of. Returning to the same tribe
after the lapse of only ten years, they found that this
dictionary had become antiquated and useless. Old
words had sunk to the ground, and new ones had risen
to the surface; and to all outward appearance the
language was completely changed.
</p>

<p>
Nothing surprised the Jesuit missionaries so much
as the immense number of languages spoken by the
natives of America. But this, far from being a proof
of a high state of civilization, rather showed that the
various races of America had never submitted, for any
length of time, to a powerful political concentration,
and that they had never succeeded in founding great
<pb n='063'/><anchor id='Pg063'/>
national empires. Hervas reduces, indeed, all the
dialects of America to eleven families<note place='foot'>Catalogo,
i. 393.</note>&mdash;four for
the south, and seven for the north; but this could
be done only by the same careful and minute comparison
which enables us to class the idioms spoken
in Iceland and Ceylon as cognate dialects. For practical
purposes the dialects of America are distinct
dialects, and the people who speak them are mutually
unintelligible.
</p>

<p>
We hear the same observations everywhere where
the rank growth of dialects has been watched by intelligent
observers. If we turn our eyes to Burmah, we
find that there the Burmese has produced a considerable
literature, and is the recognized medium of communication
not only in Burmah, but likewise in Pegu
and Arakan. But the intricate mountain ranges of the
peninsula of the Irawaddy<note place='foot'>Turanian
Languages, p. 114.</note> afford a safe refuge to many
independent tribes, speaking their own independent dialects;
and in the neighborhood of Manipura alone
Captain Gordon collected no less than twelve dialects.
<q>Some of them,</q> he says, <q>are spoken by no more
than thirty or forty families, yet so different from the
rest as to be unintelligible to the nearest neighborhood.</q>
Brown, the excellent American missionary,
who has spent his whole life in preaching the Gospel
in that part of the world, tells us that some tribes who
left their native village to settle in another valley, became
unintelligible to their forefathers in two or three
generations.<note place='foot'>Ibid., p. 233.</note>
</p>

<p>
In the north of Asia the Ostiakes, as Messerschmidt
informs us, though really speaking the same language
<pb n='064'/><anchor id='Pg064'/>
everywhere, have produced so many words and forms
peculiar to each tribe, that even within the limits of
twelve or twenty German miles, communication among
them becomes extremely difficult. Castren, the heroic
explorer of the languages of northern and central
Asia,<note place='foot'>Turanian Languages, p. 30.</note>
assures us that some of the Mongolian dialects are actually
entering into a new phase of grammatical life;
and that while the literary language of the Mongolians
has no terminations for the persons of the verb, that
characteristic feature of Turanian speech had lately
broken out in the spoken dialects of the Buriates
and in the Tungusic idioms near Njertschinsk in
Siberia.
</p>

<p>
One more observation of the same character from
the pen of Robert Moffat, in his <q>Missionary Scenes
and Labors in Southern Africa.</q> <q>The purity and
harmony of language,</q> he writes, <q>is kept up by their
pitches, or public meetings, by their festivals and ceremonies,
as well as by their songs and their constant
intercourse. With the isolated villagers of the desert
it is far otherwise; they have no such meetings; they
are compelled to traverse the wilds, often to a great
distance from their native village. On such occasions
fathers and mothers, and all who can bear a burden,
often set out for weeks at a time, and leave their children
to the care of two or three infirm old people.
The infant progeny, some of whom are beginning to
lisp, while others can just master a whole sentence, and
those still further advanced, romping and playing together,
the children of nature, through their livelong
day, <emph>become habituated to a language of their own</emph>. The
more voluble condescend to the less precocious; and
<pb n='065'/><anchor id='Pg065'/>
thus, from this infant Babel, proceeds a dialect of a
host of mongrel words and phrases, joined together
without rule, and <emph>in the course of one generation the entire
character of the language is changed</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
Such is the life of language in a state of nature; and
in a similar manner, we have a right to conclude, languages
grew up which we only know after the bit and
bridle of literature were thrown over their necks. It
need not be a written or classical literature to give an
ascendency to one out of many dialects, and to impart
to its peculiarities an undisputed legitimacy. Speeches
at pitches or public meetings, popular ballads, national
laws, religious oracles, exercise, though to a smaller
extent, the same influence. They will arrest the natural
flow of language in the countless rivulets of its
dialects, and give a permanency to certain formations
of speech which, without these external influences,
could have enjoyed but an ephemeral existence.
Though we cannot fully enter, at present, on the problem
of the origin of language, yet this we can clearly
see, that, whatever the origin of language was, its first
tendency must have been towards an unbounded variety.
To this there was, however, a natural check,
which prepared from the very beginning the growth
of national and literary languages. The language of
the father became the language of a family; the language
of a family that of a clan. In one and the
same clan different families would preserve among
themselves their own familiar forms and expressions.
They would add new words, some so fanciful and
quaint as to be hardly intelligible to other members of
the same clan. Such expressions would naturally be
suppressed, as we suppress provincial peculiarities and
<pb n='066'/><anchor id='Pg066'/>
pet words of our own, at large assemblies where all
clansmen meet and are expected to take part in general
discussions. But they would be cherished all the more
round the fire of each tent, in proportion as the general
dialect of the clan assumed a more formal character.
Class dialects, too, would spring up; the dialects of
servants, grooms, shepherds, and soldiers. Women
would have their own household words; and the rising
generation would not be long without a more racy
phraseology of their own. Even we, in this literary
age, and at a distance of thousands of years from those
early fathers of language, do not speak at home as we
speak in public. The same circumstances which give
rise to the formal language of a clan, as distinguished
from the dialects of families, produce, on a larger scale,
the languages of a confederation of clans, of nascent
colonies, of rising nationalities. Before there is a national
language, there have always been hundreds of
dialects in districts, towns, villages, clans, and families;
and though the progress of civilization and centralization
tends to reduce their number and to soften their
features, it has not as yet annihilated them, even in
our own time.
</p>

<p>
Let us now look again at what is commonly called
the history, but what ought to be called, the natural
growth, of language, and we shall easily see that it
consists chiefly in the play of the two principles which
we have just examined, <emph>phonetic decay</emph> and <emph>dialectical
regeneration</emph> or <emph>growth</emph>. Let us take the six Romance
languages. It is usual to call these the daughters of
Latin. I do not object to the names of parent and
daughter as applied to languages; only we must not
allow such apparently clear and simple terms to cover
<pb n='067'/><anchor id='Pg067'/>
obscure and vague conceptions. Now if we call Italian
the daughter of Latin, we do not mean to ascribe
to Italian a new vital principle. Not a single radical
element was newly created for the formation of Italian.
Italian is Latin in a new form. Italian is modern
Latin, or Latin ancient Italian. The names <emph>mother</emph>
and <emph>daughter</emph> only mark different periods in the growth
of a language substantially the same. To speak of
Latin dying in giving birth to her offspring is again
pure mythology, and it would be easy to prove that
Latin was a living language long after Italian had
learnt to run alone. Only let us clearly see what
we mean by Latin. The classical Latin is one out of
many dialects spoken by the Aryan inhabitants of
Italy. It was the dialect of Latium, in Latium the
dialect of Rome, at Rome the dialect of the patricians.
It was fixed by Livius Andronicus, Ennius, Nævius,
Cato, and Lucretius, polished by the Scipios, Hortensius,
and Cicero. It was the language of a restricted
class, of a political party, of a literary set. Before
their time, the language of Rome must have changed
and fluctuated considerably. Polybius tells us (iii.
22), that the best-informed Romans could not make
out without difficulty the language of the ancient
treaties between Rome and Carthage. Horace admits
(Ep. ii. 1, 86), that he could not understand the
old Salian poems, and he hints that no one else could.
Quintilian (i. 6, 40) says that the Salian priests could
hardly understand their sacred hymns. If the plebeians
had obtained the upperhand over the patricians,
Latin would have been very different from what it is
in Cicero, and we know that even Cicero, having been
brought up at Arpinum, had to give up some of his
<pb n='068'/><anchor id='Pg068'/>
provincial peculiarities, such as the dropping of the
final <emph>s</emph>, when he began to mix in fashionable society,
and had to write for his new patrician friends.<note place='foot'>Quintilian,
ix. 4. <q>Nam neque Lucilium putant uti eadem (s) ultima,
cum dicit Serenu fuit, et Dignu loco. Quin etiam Cicero in Oratore plures
antiquorum tradit sic locutos.</q> In some phrases the final <emph>s</emph> was omitted in
conversation; <hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi> <emph>abin</emph> for abisne,
<emph>viden</emph> for videsne, <emph>opu'st</emph> for opus est,
<emph>conabere</emph> for conaberis.</note> After
having been established as the language of legislation,
religion, literature, and general civilization, the classical
Latin dialect became stationary and stagnant. It
could not grow, because it was not allowed to change
or to deviate from its classical correctness. It was
haunted by its own ghost. Literary dialects, or what
are commonly called classical languages, pay for their
temporary greatness by inevitable decay. They are
like stagnant lakes at the side of great rivers. They
form reservoirs of what was once living and running
speech, but they are no longer carried on by the main
current. At times it may seem as if the whole stream
of language was absorbed by these lakes, and we can
hardly trace the small rivulets which run on in the
main bed. But if lower down, that is to say, later in
history, we meet again with a new body of stationary
language, forming or formed, we may be sure that its
tributaries were those very rivulets which for a time
were almost lost from our sight. Or it may be more
accurate to compare a classical or literary idiom with
the frozen surface of a river, brilliant and smooth, but
stiff and cold. It is mostly by political commotions
that this surface of the more polite and cultivated
speech is broken and carried away by the waters rising
underneath. It is during times when the higher classes
are either crushed in religious and social struggles, or
<pb n='069'/><anchor id='Pg069'/>
mix again with the lower classes to repel foreign invasion;
when literary occupations are discouraged, palaces
burnt, monasteries pillaged, and seats of learning
destroyed,&mdash;it is then that the popular, or, as they are
called, the vulgar dialects, which had formed a kind
of undercurrent, rise beneath the crystal surface of
the literary language, and sweep away, like the waters
in spring, the cumbrous formations of a by-gone age.
In more peaceful times, a new and popular literature
springs up in a language which <emph>seems</emph> to have been
formed by conquests or revolutions, but which, in
reality, had been growing up long before, and was
only brought out, ready made, by historical events.
From this point of view we can see that no literary
language can ever be said to have been the mother of
another language. As soon as a language loses its
unbounded capability of change, its carelessness about
what it throws away, and its readiness in always supplying
instantaneously the wants of mind and heart, its
natural life is changed into a merely artificial existence.
It may still live on for a long time, but while it seems
to be the leading shoot, it is in reality but a broken and
withering branch, slowly falling from the stock from
which it sprang. The sources of Italian are not to be
found in the classical literature of Rome, but in the
popular dialects of Italy. English did not spring from
the Anglo-Saxon of Wessex only, but from the dialects
spoken in every part of Great Britain, distinguished
by local peculiarities, and modified at different
times by the influence of Latin, Danish, Norman,
French, and other foreign elements. Some of the
local dialects of English, as spoken at the present day,
are of great importance for a critical study of English,
<pb n='070'/><anchor id='Pg070'/>
and a French prince, now living in this country, deserves
great credit for collecting what can still be saved
of English dialects. Hindustani is not the daughter
of Sanskrit, as we find it in the Vedas, or in the later
literature of the Brahmans: it is a branch of the living
speech of India, springing from the same stem
from which Sanskrit sprang, when it first assumed its
literary independence.
</p>

<p>
While thus endeavoring to place the character of
dialects, as the feeders of language, in a clear light, I
may appear to some of my hearers to have exaggerated
their importance. No doubt, if my object had been
different, I might easily have shown that, without
literary cultivation, language would never have acquired
that settled character which is essential for the communication
of thought; that it would never have fulfilled
its highest purpose, but have remained the mere jargon
of shy troglodytes. But as the importance of literary
languages is not likely to be overlooked, whereas the
importance of dialects, as far as they sustain the growth
of language, had never been pointed out, I thought it
better to dwell on the advantages which literary languages
derive from dialects, rather than on the benefits
which dialects owe to literary languages. Besides, our
chief object to-day was to explain the growth of language,
and for that purpose it is impossible to exaggerate
the importance of the constant undergrowth of
dialects. Remove a language from its native soil, tear
it away from the dialects which are its feeders, and you
arrest at once its natural growth. There will still be
the progress of phonetic corruption, but no longer the
restoring influence of dialectic regeneration. The
language which the Norwegian refugees brought to
<pb n='071'/><anchor id='Pg071'/>
Iceland has remained almost the same for seven centuries,
whereas on its native soil, and surrounded by
local dialects, it has grown into two distinct languages,
the Swedish and Danish. In the eleventh century,
the languages of Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland are
supposed<note place='foot'>Marsh, Lectures, pp. 133, 368.</note>
to have been identical, nor can we appeal
to foreign conquest, or to the admixture of foreign with
native blood, in order to account for the changes which
the language underwent in Sweden and Denmark, but
not in Iceland.<note place='foot'><q>There are fewer
local peculiarities of form and articulation in our vast
extent of territory (U. S.), than on the comparatively narrow soil of Great
Britain.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Marsh</hi>, p. 667.</note>
</p>

<p>
We can hardly form an idea of the unbounded resources
of dialects. When literary languages have
stereotyped one general term, their dialects will supply
fifty, though each with its own special shade of meaning.
If new combinations of thought are evolved in
the progress of society, dialects will readily supply the
required names from the store of their so-called superfluous
words. There are not only local and provincial,
but also class dialects. There is a dialect of shepherds,
of sportsmen, of soldiers, of farmers. I suppose there
are few persons here present who could tell the exact
meaning of a horse's poll, crest, withers, dock, hamstring,
cannon, pastern, coronet, arm, jowl, and muzzle.
Where the literary language speaks of the young
of all sorts of animals, farmers, shepherds, and sportsmen
would be ashamed to use so general a term.
</p>

<p>
<q>The idiom of nomads,</q> as Grimm says, <q>contains
an abundant wealth of manifold expressions for sword
and weapons, and for the different stages in the life of
<pb n='072'/><anchor id='Pg072'/>
their cattle. In a more highly cultivated language
these expressions become burthensome and superfluous.
But, in a peasant's mouth, the bearing, calving, falling,
and killing of almost every animal has its own peculiar
term, as the sportsman delights in calling the gait and
members of game by different names. The eye of
these shepherds, who live in the free air, sees further,
their ear hears more sharply,&mdash;why should their speech
not have gained that living truth and variety?</q>
</p>

<p>
Thus Juliana Berners, lady prioress of the nunnery
of Sopwell in the fifteenth century, the reputed author of
the book of St. Albans, informs us that we must not
use names of multitudes promiscuously, but we are to
say, <q>a congregacyon of people, a hoost of men, a felyshyppynge
of yomen, and a bevy of ladies; we must
speak of a herde of dere, swannys, cranys, or wrenys,
a sege of herons or bytourys, a muster of pecockes, a
watche of nyghtyngales, a flyghte of doves, a claterynge
of choughes, a pryde of lyons, a slewthe of
beeres, a gagle of geys, a skulke of foxes, a sculle of
frerys, a pontificality of prestys, a bomynable syght of
monkes, and a superfluyte of nonnes,</q> and so of other
human and brute assemblages. In like manner, in
dividing game for the table, the animals were not
carved, but <q>a dere was broken, a gose reryd, chekyn
frusshed, a cony unlaced, a crane dysplayed, a curlewe
unioynted, a quayle wynggyd, a swanne lyfte, a lambe
sholdered, a heron dysmembryd, a pecocke dysfygured,
a samon chynyd, a hadoke sydyd, a sole loynyd, and a
breme splayed.</q><note place='foot'>Marsh, Lectures, pp. 181, 590.</note>

<p>
What, however, I wanted particularly to point out
in this lecture is this, that neither of the causes which
<pb n='073'/><anchor id='Pg073'/>
produce the growth, or, according to others, constitute
the history of language, is under the control of man.
The phonetic decay of language is not the result of
mere accident; it is governed by definite laws, as we
shall see when we come to consider the principles of
comparative grammar. But these laws were not made
by man; on the contrary, man had to obey them without
knowing of their existence.
</p>

<p>
In the growth of the modern Romance languages
out of Latin, we can perceive not only a general tendency
to simplification, not only a natural disposition
to avoid the exertion which the pronunciation of certain
consonants, and still more, of groups of consonants,
entails on the speaker: but we can see distinct
laws for each of the Romance dialects, which enable
us to say, that in French the Latin <emph>patrem</emph> would
naturally grow into the modern <emph>père</emph>. The final <emph>m</emph>
is always dropped in the Romance dialects, and it was
dropped even in Latin. Thus we get <emph>patre</emph> instead of
<emph>patrem</emph>. Now, a Latin <emph>t</emph> between two vowels in such
words as <emph>pater</emph> is invariably suppressed in French.
This is a law, and by means of it we can discover at
once that <emph>catena</emph> must become <emph>chaine</emph>;
<emph>fata</emph>, a later feminine
representation of the old neuter <emph>fatum</emph>, <emph>fée</emph>; <emph>pratum</emph>
a meadow, <emph>pré</emph>. From <emph>pratum</emph> we derive <emph>prataria</emph>,
which in French becomes <emph>prairie</emph>; from <emph>fatum</emph>,
<emph>fataria</emph>,
the English <emph>fairy</emph>. Thus every Latin participle in
<emph>atus</emph>, like <emph>amatus</emph>, loved, must end in French in <emph>é</emph>.
The same law then changed <emph>patre</emph>(pronounced <emph>pa-tere</emph>)
into <emph>paere</emph>, or <emph>père</emph>; it changed
<emph>matrem</emph> into <emph>mère</emph>,
<emph>fratrem</emph> into <emph>frère</emph>. These changes take place gradually
but irresistibly, and, what is most important, they
are completely beyond the reach or control of the free
will of man.
</p>

<pb n='074'/><anchor id='Pg074'/>

<p>
Dialectical growth again is still more beyond the control
of individuals. For although a poet may knowingly
and intentionally invent a new word, its acceptance
depends on circumstances which defy individual
interference. There are some changes in the
grammar which at first sight might seem to be mainly
attributable to the caprice of the speaker. Granted,
for instance, that the loss of the Latin terminations
was the natural result of a more careless pronunciation;
granted that the modern sign of the French
genitive <emph>du</emph> is a natural corruption of the Latin <emph>de
illo</emph>,&mdash;yet the choice of <emph>de</emph>, instead of any other word,
to express the genitive, the choice of <emph>illo</emph>, instead of
any other pronoun, to express the article, might seem
to prove that man acted as a free agent in the formation
of language. But it is not so. No single individual
could deliberately have set to work in order
to abolish the old Latin genitive, and to replace it by
the periphrastic compound <emph>de illo</emph>. It was necessary
that the inconvenience of having no distinct or distinguishable
sign of the genitive should have been felt by
the people who spoke a vulgar Latin dialect. It was
necessary that the same people should have used the
preposition <emph>de</emph> in such a manner as to lose sight of its
original local meaning altogether (for instance, <emph>una de
multis</emph>, in Horace, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, one out of many). It was
necessary, again, that the same people should have
felt the want of an article, and should have used <emph>illo</emph>
in numerous expressions, where it seemed to have
lost its original pronominal power. It was necessary
that all these conditions should be given, before
one individual and after him another, and after
him hundreds and thousands and millions, could use
<pb n='075'/><anchor id='Pg075'/>
<emph>de illo</emph> as the exponent of the genitive; and change
it into the Italian <emph>dello</emph>, <emph>del</emph>, and the French <emph>du</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The attempts of single grammarians and purists to
improve language are perfectly bootless; and we shall
probably hear no more of schemes to prune languages
of their irregularities. It is very likely, however, that
the gradual disappearance of irregular declensions and
conjugations is due, in literary as well as in illiterate
languages, to the dialect of children. The language
of children is more regular than our own. I have
heard children say <emph>badder</emph> and <emph>baddest</emph>, instead of
<emph>worse</emph> and <emph>worst</emph>. Children will
say, <emph>I gaed</emph>, <emph>I coomd</emph>,
<emph>I catched</emph>; and it is this sense of grammatical justice,
this generous feeling of what ought to be, which in
the course of centuries has eliminated many so-called
irregular forms. Thus the auxiliary verb in Latin was
very irregular. If <emph>sumus</emph> is <emph>we are</emph>, and
<emph>sunt</emph>, <emph>they are</emph>,
the second person, <emph>you are</emph>, ought to have been, at least
according to the strict logic of children, <emph>sutis</emph>. This,
no doubt, sounds very barbarous to a classical ear accustomed
to <emph>estis</emph>. And we see how French, for instance,
has strictly preserved the Latin forms in <emph>nous
sommes</emph>, <emph>vous êtes</emph>, <emph>ils sont</emph>. But in Spanish we find
<emph>somos</emph>, <emph>sois</emph>, <emph>son</emph>;
and this <emph>sois</emph> stands for <emph>sutis</emph>. We
find similar traces of grammatical levelling in the
Italian <emph>siamo</emph>, <emph>siete</emph>, <emph>sono</emph>,
formed in analogy of regular verbs such as <emph>crediamo</emph>,
<emph>credete</emph>, <emph>credono</emph>. The second
person, <emph>sei</emph>, instead of <emph>es</emph>, is likewise infantine grammar.
So are the Wallachian <emph>súntemu</emph>, we are, <emph>súnteti</emph>, you are,
which owe their origin to the third person plural <emph>súnt</emph>,
they are. And what shall we say of such monsters as
<emph>essendo</emph>, a gerund derived on principles of strict justice
from an infinitive <emph>essere</emph>, like <emph>credendo</emph>
from <emph>credere</emph>!
</p>

<pb n='076'/><anchor id='Pg076'/>

<p>
However, we need not be surprised, for we find similar
barbarisms in English. Even in Anglo-Saxon, the
third person plural, <emph>sind</emph>, has by a false analogy been
transferred to the first and second persons; and instead
of the modern English,
</p>

<p>
Dialectically we hear <emph>I be</emph>, instead of <emph>I am</emph>; and if
Chartism should ever gain the upper hand, we must be
prepared for newspapers adopting such forms as <emph>I says</emph>,
<emph>I knows</emph>.
</p>

<p>
These various influences and conditions under which
language grows and changes, are like the waves and
winds which carry deposits to the bottom of the sea,
where they accumulate, and rise, and grow, and at last
appear on the surface of the earth as a stratum, perfectly
intelligible in all its component parts, not produced
by an inward principle of growth, nor regulated
by invariable laws of nature; yet, on the other hand,
by no means the result of mere accident, or the production
of lawless and uncontrolled agencies. We
cannot be careful enough in the use of our words.
Strictly speaking, neither <emph>history</emph> nor <emph>growth</emph> is applicable
to the changes of the shifting surface of the earth.
<emph>History</emph> applies to the actions of free agents; <emph>growth</emph> to
the natural unfolding of organic beings. We speak,
however, of the growth of the crust of the earth, and
we know what we mean by it; and it is in this sense,
<pb n='077'/><anchor id='Pg077'/>
but not in the sense of growth as applied to a tree, that
we have a right to speak of the growth of language.
If that modification which takes place in time by continually
new combinations of given elements, which
withdraws itself from the control of free agents, and
can in the end be recognized as the result of natural
agencies, may be called growth; and if so defined, we
may apply it to the growth of the crust of the earth;
the same word, in the same sense, will be applicable to
language, and will justify us in removing the science
of language from the pale of the historical to that of
the physical sciences.
</p>

<p>
There is another objection which we have to consider,
and the consideration of which will again help
us to understand more clearly the real character of
language. The great periods in the growth of the
earth which have been established by geological research
are brought to their close, or very nearly so,
when we discover the first vestiges of human life, and
when the history of man, in the widest sense of the
word, begins. The periods in the growth of language,
on the contrary, begin and run parallel with the history
of man. It has been said, therefore, that although
language may not be merely a work of art, it would,
nevertheless, be impossible to understand the life and
growth of any language without an historical knowledge
of the times in which that language grew up.
We ought to know, it is said, whether a language
which is to be analyzed under the microscope of comparative
grammar, has been growing up wild, among
wild tribes, without a literature, oral or written, in
poetry or in prose; or whether it has received the cultivation
of poets, priests, and orators, and retained the
<pb n='078'/><anchor id='Pg078'/>
impress of a classical age. Again, it is only from the
annals of political history that we can learn whether
one language has come in contact with another, how
long this contact has lasted, which of the two nations
stood higher in civilization, which was the conquering
and which the conquered, which of the two established
the laws, the religion, and the arts of the country,
and which produced the greatest number of national
teachers, popular poets, and successful demagogues.
All these questions are of a purely historical character,
and the science which has to borrow so much from
historical sources, might well be considered an anomaly
in the sphere of the physical sciences.
</p>

<p>
Now, in answer to this, it cannot be denied that
among the physical sciences none is so intimately connected
with the history of man as the science of language.
But a similar connection, though in a less
degree, can be shown to exist between other branches
of physical research and the history of man. In
zoölogy, for instance, it is of some importance to know
at what particular period of history, in what country,
and for what purposes certain animals were tamed and
domesticated. In ethnology, a science, we may remark
in passing, quite distinct from the science of
language, it would be difficult to account for the Caucasian
stamp impressed on the Mongolian race in
Hungary, or on the Tatar race in Turkey, unless we
knew from written documents the migrations and settlements
of the Mongolic and Tataric tribes in Europe.
A botanist, again, comparing several specimens of rye,
would find it difficult to account for their respective
peculiarities, unless he knew that in some parts of the
world this plant has been cultivated for centuries,
<pb n='079'/><anchor id='Pg079'/>
whereas in other regions, as, for instance, in Mount
Caucasus, it is still allowed to grow wild. Plants
have their own countries, like races, and the presence
of the cucumber in Greece, the orange and cherry in
Italy, the potatoe in England, and the vine at the Cape,
can be fully explained by the historian only. The
more intimate relation, therefore, between the history
of language and the history of man is not sufficient to
exclude the science of language from the circle of the
physical sciences.
</p>

<p>
Nay, it might be shown, that, if strictly defined, the
science of language can declare itself completely independent
of history. If we speak of the language of
England, we ought, no doubt, to know something of
the political history of the British Isles, in order to
understand the present state of that language. Its history
begins with the early Britons, who spoke a Celtic
dialect; it carries us on to the Saxon conquest, to the
Danish invasions, to the Norman conquest: and we
see how each of these political events contributed to
the formation of the character of the language. The
language of England may be said to have been in succession
Celtic, Saxon, Norman, and English. But if
we speak of the history of the English language, we
enter on totally different ground. The English language
was never Celtic, the Celtic never grew into
Saxon, nor the Saxon into Norman, nor the Norman
into English. The history of the Celtic language runs
on to the present day. It matters not whether it be
spoken by all the inhabitants of the British Isles, or
only by a small minority in Wales, Ireland, and Scotland.
A language, as long as it is spoken by anybody,
lives and has its substantive existence. The last
<pb n='080'/><anchor id='Pg080'/>
old woman that spoke Cornish, and to whose memory
it is now intended to raise a monument, represented by
herself alone the ancient language of Cornwall. A
Celt may become an Englishman, Celtic and English
blood may be mixed; and who could tell at the present
day the exact proportion of Celtic and Saxon
blood in the population of England? But languages
are never mixed. It is indifferent by what name
the language spoken in the British Islands be called,
whether English or British or Saxon; to the student
of language English is Teutonic, and nothing but
Teutonic. The physiologist may protest, and point
out that in many instances the skull, or the bodily
habitat of the English language, is of a Celtic type;
the genealogist may protest and prove that the arms
of many an English family are of Norman origin; the
student of language must follow his own way. Historical
information as to an early substratum of Celtic
inhabitants in Britain, as to Saxon, Danish, and Norman
invasions may be useful to him. But though
every record were burned, and every skull mouldered,
the English language, as spoken by any ploughboy,
would reveal its own history, if analyzed according to
the rules of comparative grammar. Without the help
of history, we should see that English is Teutonic,
that like Dutch and Friesian it belongs to the Low-German
branch; that this branch, together with the
High-German, Gothic, and Scandinavian branches,
constitute the Teutonic class; that this Teutonic class,
together with the Celtic, Slavonic, the Hellenic, Italic,
Iranic, and Indic classes constitute the great Indo-European
or Aryan family of speech. In the English
dictionary the student of the science of language
<pb n='081'/><anchor id='Pg081'/>
can detect, by his own tests, Celtic, Norman, Greek,
and Latin ingredients, but not a single drop of foreign
blood has entered into the organic system of the English
language. The grammar, the blood and soul of
the language, is as pure and unmixed in English as
spoken in the British Isles, as it was when spoken on
the shores of the German Ocean by the Angles, Saxons,
and Juts of the continent.
</p>

<p>
In thus considering and refuting the objections which
have been, or might be, made against the admission of
the science of language into the circle of the physical
sciences, we have arrived at some results which it may
be useful to recapitulate before we proceed further.
We saw that whereas philology treats language only as
a means, comparative philology chooses language as the
object of scientific inquiry. It is not the study of one
language, but of many, and in the end of all, which
forms the aim of this new science. Nor is the language
of Homer of greater interest, in the scientific
treatment of human speech, than the dialect of the
Hottentots.
</p>

<p>
We saw, secondly, that after the first practical acquisition
and careful analysis of the facts and forms of
any language, the next and most important step is the
classification of all the varieties of human speech, and
that only after this has been accomplished would it be
safe to venture on the great questions which underlie
all physical research, the questions as to the what, the
whence, and the why of language.
</p>

<p>
We saw, thirdly, that there is a distinction between
what is called history and growth. We determined the
true meaning of growth, as applied to language, and
perceived how it was independent of the caprice of
<pb n='082'/><anchor id='Pg082'/>
man, and governed by laws that could be discovered
by careful observation, and be traced back in the end
to higher laws, which govern the organs both of human
thought, and of the human voice. Though admitting
that the science of language was more intimately connected
than any other physical science with what is
called the political history of man, we found that,
strictly speaking, our science might well dispense with
this auxiliary, and that languages can be analyzed and
classified on their own evidence particularly on the
strength of their grammatical articulation, without
any reference to the individuals, families, clans, tribes,
nations, or races by whom they are or have been
spoken.
</p>

<p>
In the course of these considerations, we had to lay
down two axioms, to which we shall frequently have to
appeal in the progress of our investigations. The first
declares grammar to be the most essential element, and
therefore the ground of classification in all languages
which have produced a definite grammatical articulation;
the second denies the possibility of a mixed
language.
</p>

<p>
These two axioms are, in reality, but one, as we
shall see when we examine them more closely.
There is hardly a language which in one sense may
not be called a mixed language. No nation or tribe
was ever so completely isolated as not to admit the
importation of a certain number of foreign words.
In some instances these imported words have changed
the whole native aspect of the language, and have
even acquired a majority over the native element.
Turkish is a Turanian dialect; its grammar is purely
Tataric or Turanian. The Turks, however, possessed
<pb n='083'/><anchor id='Pg083'/>
but a small literature and narrow civilization
before they were converted to Mohammedanism. Now,
the language of Mohammed was Arabic, a branch of
the Semitic family, closely allied to Hebrew and Syriac.
Together with the Koran, and their law and religion,
the Turks learned from the Arabs, their conquerors,
many of the arts and sciences connected with a more
advanced stage of civilization. Arabic became to the
Turks what Latin was to the Germans during the
Middle Ages; and there is hardly a word in the higher
intellectual terminology of Arabic, that might not be
used, more or less naturally, by a writer in Turkish.
But the Arabs, again, at the very outset of their career
of conquest and conversion, had been, in science, art,
literature, and polite manners, the pupils of the Persians,
whom they had conquered; they stood to them in
the same relation as the Romans stood to the Greeks.
Now, the Persians speak a language which is neither
Semitic, like Arabic, nor Turanian, like Turkish; it is
a branch of the Indo-European or Aryan family of
speech. A large infusion of Persian words thus found
its way into Arabic, and through Arabic into Turkish;
and the result is that at the present moment the Turkish
language, as spoken by the higher ranks at Constantinople,
is so entirely overgrown with Persian and Arabic
words, that a common clod from the country understands
but little of the so-called Osmanli, though its
grammar is exactly the same as the grammar which he
uses in his Tataric utterance.
</p>

<p>
There is, perhaps, no language so full of words evidently
derived from the most distant sources as English.
Every country of the globe seems to have brought some
of its verbal manufactures to the intellectual market of
<pb n='084'/><anchor id='Pg084'/>
England. Latin, Greek, Hebrew, Celtic, Saxon, Danish,
French, Spanish, Italian, German&mdash;nay, even Hindustani,
Malay, and Chinese words, lie mixed together
in the English dictionary. On the evidence of words
alone it would be impossible to classify English with
any other of the established stocks and stems of human
speech. Leaving out of consideration the smaller ingredients,
we find, on comparing the Teutonic with
the Latin, or Neo-Latin or Norman elements in English,
that the latter have a decided majority over the
home-grown Saxon terms. This may seem incredible;
and if we simply took a page of any English book, and
counted therein the words of purely Saxon and Latin
origin, the majority would be no doubt on the Saxon
side. The articles, pronouns, prepositions, and auxiliary
verbs, all of which are of Saxon growth, occur
over and over again in one and the same page. Thus,
Hickes maintained that nine tenths of the English dictionary
were Saxon, because there were only three
words of Latin origin in the Lord's prayer. Sharon
Turner, who extended his observations over a larger
field, came to the conclusion that the relation of Norman
to Saxon was as four to six. Another writer,
who estimates the whole number of English words at
38,000, assigns 23,000 to a Saxon, and 15,000 to a
classical source. On taking, however, a more accurate
inventory, and counting every word in the dictionaries
of Robertson and Webster, M. Thommerel
has established the fact that of the sum total of 43,566
words, 29,853 came from classical, 13,230 from Teutonic,
and the rest from miscellaneous sources.<note place='foot'>Some
excellent statistics on the exact proportion of Saxon and Latin
in various English writers, are to be found in Marsh's Lectures on the English
Language, p. 120, <hi rend='italic'>seq.</hi> and 181,

<pb n='085'/><anchor id='Pg085'/>
evidence of its dictionary, therefore, and treating English
as a mixed language, it would have to be classified
together with French, Italian, and Spanish, as one of
the Romance or Neo-Latin dialects. Languages, however,
though mixed in their dictionary, can never be
mixed in their grammar. Hervas was told by missionaries
that in the middle of the eighteenth century the
Araucans used hardly a single word which was not Spanish,
though they preserved both the grammar and the
syntax of their own native speech.<note place='foot'><q>En este

This is the reason
why grammar is made the criterion of the relationship
and the base of the classification in almost all languages;
and it follows, therefore, as a matter of course,
that in the classification and in the science of language,
it is impossible to admit the existence of a mixed idiom.
We may form whole sentences in English consisting entirely
of Latin or Romance words; yet whatever there
is left of grammar in English bears unmistakable traces
of Teutonic workmanship. What may now be called
grammar in English is little more than the terminations
of the genitive singular, and nominative plural
of nouns, the degrees of comparison, and a few of the
persons and tenses of the verb. Yet the single <emph>s</emph>, used
as the exponent of the third person singular of the indicative
present, is irrefragable evidence that in a scientific
classification of languages, English, though it did
not retain a single word of Saxon origin, would have
<pb n='086'/><anchor id='Pg086'/>
to be classed as Saxon, and as a branch of the great
Teutonic stem of the Aryan family of speech. In ancient
and less matured languages, grammar, or the
formal part of human speech, is far more abundantly
developed than in English; and it is, therefore, a much
safer guide for discovering a family likeness in scattered
members of the same family. There are languages in
which there is no trace of what we are accustomed to
call grammar; for instance, ancient Chinese; there are
others in which we can still watch the growth of grammar,
or, more correctly, the gradual lapse of material
into merely formal elements. In these languages new
principles of classification will have to be applied, such
as are suggested by the study of natural history; and
we shall have to be satisfied with the criteria of a morphological
affinity, instead of those of a genealogical
relationship.
</p>

<p>
I have thus answered, I hope, some of the objections
which threatened to deprive the science of language of
that place which she claims in the circle of the physical
sciences. We shall see in our next lecture what the
history of our science has been from its beginning to
the present day, and how far it may be said to have
passed through the three stages, the empirical, the classificatory,
and the theoretical, which mark the childhood,
the youth, and the manhood of every one of the
natural sciences.

<head>Lecture III. The Empirical Stage.</head>

<p>
We begin to-day to trace the historical progress of
the science of language in its three stages, the <emph>Empirical</emph>,
the <emph>Classificatory</emph>, and the <emph>Theoretical</emph>. As a general
rule each physical science begins with analysis, proceeds
to classification, and ends with theory; but, as I
pointed out in my first lecture, there are frequent exceptions
to this rule, and it is by no means uncommon to find
that philosophical speculations, which properly belong
to the last or theoretical stage, were attempted in physical
sciences long before the necessary evidence had
been collected or arranged. Thus, we find that the
science of language, in the only two countries where
we can watch its origin and history&mdash;in India and
Greece&mdash;rushes at once into theories about the mysterious
nature of speech, and cares as little for facts
as the man who wrote an account of the camel without
ever having seen the animal or the desert. The
Brahmans, in the hymns of the Veda, raised language
to the rank of a deity, as they did with all things of
which they knew not what they were. They addressed
hymns to her in which she is said to have
been with the gods from the beginning, achieving
wondrous things, and never revealed to man except
in part. In the Bráhmaņas, language is called the
<pb n='088'/><anchor id='Pg088'/>
cow, breath the bull, and their young is said to be
the mind of man.<note place='foot'>Colebrooke, Miscellaneous
Essays, i. 32. The following verses are pronounced
by Vâch, the goddess of speech, in the 125th hymn of the 10th
book of the Rig-Veda: <q>Even I myself say this (what is) welcome to Gods
and to men: <q>Whom I love, him I make strong, him I make a Brahman,
him a great prophet, him I make wise. For Rudra (the god of thunder) I
bend the bow, to slay the enemy, the hater of the Brahmans. For the
people I make war; I pervade heaven and earth. I bear the father on the
summit of this world; my origin is in the water in the sea; from thence I
go forth among all beings, and touch this heaven with my height. I myself
breathe forth like the wind, embracing all beings; above this heaven,
beyond this earth, such am I in greatness.</q></q> See also Atharva-Veda, iv.
30; xix. 9, 3. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, part iii. pp. 108,
150.</note> Brahman, the highest being, is
said to be known through speech, nay, speech herself
is called the Supreme Brahman. At a very early
period, however, the Brahmans recovered from their
raptures about language, and set to work with wonderful
skill dissecting her sacred body. Their achievements
in grammatical analysis, which date from the
sixth century, <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, are still unsurpassed in the grammatical
literature of any nation. The idea of reducing
a whole language to a small number of roots,
which in Europe was not attempted before the sixteenth
century by Henry Estienne,<note place='foot'>Sir
John Stoddart, Glossology, p. 276.</note> was perfectly
familiar to the Brahmans, at least 500 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Greeks, though they did not raise language to
the rank of a deity, paid her, nevertheless, the greatest
honors in their ancient schools of philosophy. There
is hardly one of their representative philosophers who
has not left some saying on the nature of language.
The world without, or nature, and the world within,
or mind, did not excite more wonder and elicit deeper
oracles of wisdom from the ancient sages of Greece
than language, the image of both, of nature and of
<pb n='089'/><anchor id='Pg089'/>
mind. <q>What is language?</q> was a question asked
quite as early as <q>What am I?</q> and, <q>What is all this
world around me?</q> The problem of language was
in fact a recognized battle-field for the different schools
of ancient Greek philosophy, and we shall have to
glance at their early guesses on the nature of human
speech, when we come to consider the third or theoretical
stage in the science of language.
</p>

<p>
At present, we have to look for the early traces of
the first or empirical stage. And here it might seem
doubtful what was the real work to be assigned to
this stage. What can be meant by the empirical treatment
of language? Who were the men that did for
language what the sailor did for his stars, the miner for
his minerals, the gardener for his flowers? Who was
the first to give any thought to language?&mdash;to distinguish
between its component parts, between nouns and
verbs, between articles and pronouns, between the nominative
and accusative, the active and passive? Who
invented these terms, and for what purpose were they
invented?
</p>

<p>
We must be careful in answering these questions,
for, as I said before, the merely empirical analysis of
language was preceded in Greece by more general inquiries
into the nature of thought and language; and
the result has been that many of the technical terms
which form the nomenclature of empirical grammar,
existed in the schools of philosophy long before they
were handed over, ready made, to the grammarian.
The distinction of noun and verb, or more correctly,
of subject and predicate, was the work of philosophers.
Even the technical terms of case, of number, and gender,
were coined at a very early time for the purpose
<pb n='090'/><anchor id='Pg090'/>
of entering into the nature of thought; not for the
practical purpose of analyzing the forms of language.
This, their practical application to the spoken language
of Greece, was the work of a later generation. It was
the teacher of languages who first compared the categories
of thought with the realities of the Greek language.
It was he who transferred the terminology of
Aristotle and the Stoics from thought to speech, from
logic to grammar; and thus opened the first roads
into the impervious wilderness of spoken speech. In
doing this, the grammarian had to alter the strict acceptation
of many of the terms which he borrowed
from the philosopher, and he had to coin others before
he could lay hold of all the facts of language even in the
roughest manner. For, indeed, the distinction between
noun and verb, between active and passive, between
nominative and accusative, does not help us much towards
a scientific analysis of language. It is no more
than a first grasp, and it can only be compared with
the most elementary terminology in other branches of
human knowledge. Nevertheless, it was a beginning,
a very important beginning; and if we preserve in our
histories of the world the names of those who are said
to have discovered the four physical elements, the
names of a Thales and Anaximenes, we ought not
to forget the names of the discoverers of the elements
of language&mdash;the founders of one of the most useful
and most successful branches of philosophy&mdash;the first
Grammarians.
</p>

<p>
Grammar then, in the usual sense of the word, or
the merely formal and empirical analysis of language,
owes its origin, like all other sciences, to a very natural
and practical want. The first practical grammarian
<pb n='091'/><anchor id='Pg091'/>
was the first practical teacher of languages, and if
we want to know the beginnings of the science of
language, we must try to find out at what time in
the history of the world, and under what circumstances,
people first thought of learning any language
besides their own. At <emph>that</emph> time we shall find the
first practical grammar, and not till then. Much
may have been ready at hand through the less interested
researches of philosophers, and likewise through
the critical studies of the scholars of Alexandria on
the ancient forms of their language as preserved in
the Homeric poems. But rules of declension and
conjugation, paradigms of regular and irregular nouns
and verbs, observations on syntax, and the like, these
are the work of the teachers of languages, and of no
one else.
</p>

<p>
Now, the teaching of languages, though at present
so large a profession, is comparatively a very modern
invention. No ancient Greek ever thought of learning
a foreign language. Why should he? He divided the
whole world into Greeks and Barbarians, and he would
have felt himself degraded by adopting either the dress
or the manners or the language of his barbarian neighbors.
He considered it a privilege to speak Greek, and
even dialects closely related to his own, were treated
by him as mere jargons. It takes time before people
conceive the idea that it is possible to express oneself
in any but one's own language. The Poles called
their neighbors, the Germans, <emph>Niemiec</emph>, <emph>niemy</emph> meaning
<emph>dumb</emph>;<note place='foot'>The Turks applied the Polish
name <emph>Niemiec</emph> to the Austrians. As early
as Constantinus Porphyrogeneta, cap. 30, Νεμέτζιοι was used for the German
race of the Bavarians. (Pott, Indo-Germ. Sp. s. 44. Leo, Zeitschrift
für Vergleichende Sprachforschung, b. ii. s. 258.) Russian,
<emph>njemez'</emph>; Slovenian, <emph>nĕmec</emph>; Bulgarian, <emph>némec</emph>;
Polish, <emph>niemiec</emph>; Lusatian, <emph>njemc</emph>, mean
German. Russian, <emph>njemo</emph>, indistinct; <emph>njemyi</emph>,
dumb; Slovenian, <emph>nĕm</emph>, dumb;
Bulgarian, <emph>nêm</emph>, dumb; Polish, <emph>njemy</emph>,
dumb; Lusatian, <emph>njemy</emph>, dumb.</note> just as the Greeks called the Barbarians
<pb n='092'/><anchor id='Pg092'/>
<emph>Aglossoi</emph>, or speechless. The name which the Germans
gave to their neighbors, the Celts, <emph>Walh</emph> in old
High German, <emph>vealh</emph> in Anglo-Saxon, the modern
<emph>Welsh</emph>, is supposed to be the same as the Sanskrit
<emph>mlechha</emph>, and means a person who talks
indistinctly.<note place='foot'>Leo, Zeitschrift für Vergl. Sprachf. b. ii. s. 252.</note>
</p>

<p>
Even when the Greeks began to feel the necessity
of communicating with foreign nations, when they
felt a desire of learning their idioms, the problem was
by no means solved. For how was a foreign language
to be learnt as long as either party could only speak
their own? The problem was almost as difficult as
when, as we are told by some persons, the first men,
as yet speechless, came together in order to invent
speech, and to discuss the most appropriate names
that should be given to the perceptions of the senses
and the abstractions of the mind. At first, it must
be supposed that the Greek learned foreign languages
very much as children learn their own. The interpreters
mentioned by ancient historians were probably
children of parents speaking different languages. The
son of a Scythian and a Greek would naturally learn
the utterances both of his father and mother, and the
lucrative nature of his services would not fail to increase
the supply. We are told, though on rather
mythical authority, that the Greeks were astonished
at the multiplicity of languages which they encountered
during the Argonautic expedition, and that they
were much inconvenienced by the want of skilful
interpreters.<note place='foot'>Humboldt's Cosmos, vol. ii. p. 141.</note>
We need not wonder at this, for the
<pb n='093'/><anchor id='Pg093'/>
English army was hardly better off than the army
of Jason; and such is the variety of dialects spoken
in the Caucasian Isthmus, that it is still called by the
inhabitants <q>the Mountain of Languages.</q> If we turn
our eyes from these mythical ages to the historical times
of Greece, we find that trade gave the first encouragement
to the profession of interpreters. Herodotus tells
us (iv. 24), that caravans of Greek merchants, following
the course of the Volga upwards to the Oural
mountains, were accompanied by seven interpreters,
speaking seven different languages. These must have
comprised Slavonic, Tataric, and Finnic dialects, spoken
in those countries in the time of Herodotus, as they are
at the present day. The wars with Persia first familiarized
the Greeks with the idea that other nations also
possessed real languages. Themistocles studied Persian,
and is said to have spoken it fluently. The expedition
of Alexander contributed still more powerfully
to a knowledge of other nations and languages. But
when Alexander went to converse with the Brahmans,
who were even then considered by the Greeks as the
guardians of a most ancient and mysterious wisdom,
their answers had to be translated by so many interpreters
that one of the Brahmans remarked, they must
become like water that had passed through many impure
channels.<note place='foot'>This shows how difficult it would be to admit that any
influence was exercised by Indian on Greek philosophers. Pyrrhon, if we may believe
Alexander Polyhistor, seems indeed to have accompanied Alexander on his
expedition to India, and one feels tempted to connect the scepticism of
Pyrrhon with the system of Buddhist philosophy then current in India.
But the ignorance of the language on both sides must have been an insurmountable
barrier between the Greek and the Indian thinkers. (Fragmenta
Histor. Græc., ed. Müller, t. iii. p. 243, <hi rend='italic'>b.</hi>;
Lasson, Indische Alterthumskande,
b. iii. s. 380.)</note> We hear, indeed, of more ancient
<pb n='094'/><anchor id='Pg094'/>
Greek travellers, and it is difficult to understand how,
in those early times, anybody could have travelled without
a certain knowledge of the language of the people
through whose camps and villages and towns he
had to pass. Many of these travels, however, particularly
those which are said to have extended as
far as India, are mere inventions of later writers.<note place='foot'>On
the supposed travels of Greek philosophers to India, see Lassen, Indische
Alterthumskunde, b. iii. s. 379; Brandis, Handbuch der Geschichte
der Philosophie, b. i. s. 425. The opinion of D. Stewart and Niebuhr that
the Indian philosophers borrowed from the Greeks, and that of Görres and
others that the Greeks borrowed from the Brahmans, are examined in my
Essay on Indian Logic, in Thomson's Laws of Thought.</note>
Lycurgus may have travelled to Spain and Africa,
he certainly did not proceed to India, nor is there
any mention of his intercourse with the Indian Gymnosophists
before Aristocrates, who lived about 100 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>
The travels of Pythagoras are equally mythical; they
are inventions of Alexandrian writers, who believed
that all wisdom must have flowed from the East.
There is better authority for believing that Democritus
went to Egypt and Babylon, but his more distant
travels to India are likewise legendary. Herodotus,
though he travelled in Egypt and Persia, never
gives us to understand that he was able to converse
in any but his own language.
</p>

<p>
As far as we can tell, the barbarians seem to have
possessed a greater facility for acquiring languages than
either Greeks or Romans. Soon after the Macedonian
conquest, we find<note place='foot'>See Niebuhr, Vorlesungen über Alte Geschichte,

third Punic war.</note> Their works
<pb n='095'/><anchor id='Pg095'/>
were written in Greek, and for the Greeks. The native
language of Berosus was Babylonian, of Menander
Phenician, of Manetho Egyptian. Berosus was able
to read the cuneiform documents of Babylonia with
the same ease with which Manetho read the papyri of
Egypt. The almost contemporaneous appearance of
three such men, barbarians by birth and language, who
were anxious to save the histories of their countries
from total oblivion, by entrusting them to the keeping
of their conquerors, the Greeks, is highly significant.
But what is likewise significant, and by no means
creditable to the Greek or Macedonian conquerors, is
the small value which they seem to have set on these
works. They have all been lost, and are known to us
by fragments only, though there can be little doubt
that the work of Berosus would have been an invaluable
guide to the student of the cuneiform inscriptions
and of Babylonian history, and that Manetho, if preserved
complete, would have saved us volumes of controversy
on Egyptian chronology. We learn, however,
from the almost simultaneous appearance of these
works, that soon after the epoch marked by Alexander's
conquests in the East, the Greek language was
studied and cultivated by literary men of barbarian
origin, though we should look in vain for any Greek
<pb n='096'/><anchor id='Pg096'/>
learning or employing any but his own tongue for literary
purposes. We hear of no intellectual intercourse
between Greeks and barbarians before the days of
Alexander and Alexandria. At Alexandria, various
nations, speaking different languages, and believing in
different gods, were brought together. Though primarily
engaged in mercantile speculations, it was but natural
that in their moments of leisure they should hold
discourse on their native countries, their gods, their
kings, their law-givers, and poets. Besides, there were
Greeks at Alexandria who were engaged in the study
of antiquity, and who knew how to ask questions from
men coming from any country of the world. The
pretension of the Egyptians to a fabulous antiquity, the
belief of the Jews in the sacred character of their laws,
the faith of the Persians in the writings of Zoroaster,
all these were fit subjects for discussion in the halls and
libraries of Alexandria. We probably owe the translation
of the Old Testament, the Septuagint, to this
spirit of literary inquiry which was patronized at Alexandria
by the Ptolemies.<note place='foot'>Ptolemæus Philadelphus
(287-246 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>), on the recommendation of
his chief librarian (Demetrius Philaretes), is said to have sent a Jew of the
name of Aristeas, to Jerusalem, to ask the high priest for a MS. of the
Bible, and for seventy interpreters. Others maintain that the Hellenistic
Jews who lived at Alexandria, and who had almost forgotten their native
language, had this translation made for their own benefit. Certain it is,
that about the beginning of the third century
<hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi> (285), we find the Hebrew
Bible translated into Greek.</note> The writings of Zoroaster
also, the Zend-Avesta, would seem to have been rendered
into Greek about the same time. For Hermippus,

one of the most learned scholars at Alexandria.
</p>

<p>
But although we find at Alexandria these and similar
traces of a general interest having been excited by
the literatures of other nations, there is no evidence
which would lead us to suppose that their languages
also had become the subject of scientific inquiry. It
was not through the study of other languages, but
through the study of the ancient dialects of their own
language, that the Greeks at Alexandria were first led
to what we should call critical and philological studies.
The critical study of Greek took its origin at Alexandria,
and it was chiefly based on the text of Homer.
The general outline of grammar existed, as I remarked
before, at an earlier period. It grew up in the schools
of Greek philosophers.<note place='foot'>M. M.'s History
of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 163.</note> Plato knew of noun and
verb as the two component parts of speech. Aristotle
added conjunctions and articles. He likewise observed
the distinctions of number and case. But neither Plato
nor Aristotle paid much attention to the forms of language
which corresponded to these forms of thought,
nor had they any inducement to reduce them to any
practical rules. With Aristotle the verb or <emph>rhēmha</emph> is
hardly more than predicate, and in sentences such as
<q>the snow is white,</q> he would have called <emph>white</emph> a
<pb n='098'/><anchor id='Pg098'/>
verb. The first who reduced the actual forms of language
to something like order were the scholars of
Alexandria. Their chief occupation was to publish
correct texts of the Greek classics, and particularly of
Homer. They were forced, therefore, to pay attention
to the exact forms of Greek grammar. The MSS.
sent to Alexandria and Pergamus from different parts
of Greece varied considerably, and it could only be
determined by careful observation which forms were to
be tolerated in Homer and which were not. Their
editions of Homer were not only <emph>ekdoseis</emph>, a Greek
word literally rendered in Latin by <emph>editio</emph>,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> issues
of books, but <emph>diorthōseis</emph>, that is to say, critical editions.
There were different schools, opposed to each other in
their views of the language of Homer. Each reading
that was adopted by Zenodotus or Aristarchus had to
be defended, and this could only be done by establishing
general rules on the grammar of the Homeric
poems. Did Homer use the article? Did he use it
before proper names? These and similar questions
had to be settled, and as one or the other view was
adopted by the editors, the text of these ancient poems
was changed by more or less violent emendations. New
technical terms were required for distinguishing, for instance,
the article, if once recognized, from the demonstrative
pronoun. <emph>Article</emph> is a literal translation of the Greek
word <emph>arthron</emph>. <emph>Arthron</emph> (Lat. artus) means the socket
of a joint. The word was first used by Aristotle, and
with him it could only mean words which formed, as it
were, the sockets in which the members of a sentence
moved. In such a sentence as: <q>Whoever did it, he
shall suffer for it,</q> Greek grammarians would have
called the demonstrative pronoun <emph>he</emph> the first socket,
<pb n='099'/><anchor id='Pg099'/>
and the relative pronoun <emph>who</emph>, the second
socket;<note place='foot'>ἄρθρον προτασσόμενον, ἄρθρον ὑποτασσόμενον.</note> and
before Zenodotus, the first librarian of Alexandria,
250 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, all pronouns were simply classed as sockets
or articles of speech. He was the first to introduce a
distinction between personal pronouns or <emph>antonymiai</emph>,
and the mere articles or articulations of speech, which
henceforth retained the name of <emph>arthra</emph>. This distinction
was very necessary, and it was, no doubt, suggested
to him by his emendations of the text of Homer,
Zenodotus being the first who restored the article before
proper names in the Iliad and Odyssey. Who,
in speaking now of the definite or indefinite article,
thinks of the origin and original meaning of the word,
and of the time which it took before it could become
what it is now, a technical term familiar to every
school-boy?
</p>

<p>
Again, to take another illustration of the influence
which the critical study of Homer at Alexandria exercised
on the development of grammatical terminology,&mdash;we
see that the first idea of numbers, of a
singular and a plural, was fixed and defined by the
philosopher. But Aristotle had no such technical
terms as singular and plural; and he does not even allude
to the dual. He only speaks of the cases which
express one or many, though with him <emph>case</emph>, or <emph>ptōsis</emph>, had
a very different meaning from what it has in our grammars.
The terms singular and plural were not invented
till they were wanted, and they were first wanted
by the grammarians. Zenodotus, the editor of Homer,
was the first to observe the use of the dual in the Homeric
poems, and, with the usual zeal of discoverers,
he has altered many a plural into a dual when there
was no necessity for it.
</p>

<pb n='100'/><anchor id='Pg100'/>

<p>
The scholars of Alexandria, therefore, and of the
rival academy of Pergamus, were the first who studied
the Greek language critically, that is to say, who analyzed
the language, arranged it under general categories,
distinguished the various parts of speech, invented
proper technical terms for the various functions of
words, observed the more or less correct usage of
certain poets, marked the difference between obsolete
and classical forms, and published long and learned
treatises on all these subjects. Their works mark a
great era in the history of the science of language.
But there was still a step to be made before we can
expect to meet with a real practical or elementary
grammar of the Greek language. Now the first real
Greek grammar was that of <hi rend='italic'>Dionysius Thrax</hi>. It is
still in existence, and though its genuineness has been
doubted, these doubts have been completely disposed of.
</p>

<p>
But who was Dionysius Thrax? His father, as we
learn from his name, was a Thracian; but Dionysius
himself lived at Alexandria, and was a pupil of the
famous critic and editor of Homer, Aristarchus.<note place='foot'>Suidas,
s. v. Διονύσιος. Διονύσιος Ἀλεξανδρεός, Θρᾷξ δὲ ἀπὸ πατρὸς
τούνομα κληθεὶς, Ἀριστάρχου μαθητὴς, γραμματικὸς ὁς ἐσοφίστευσεν ἐν
Ῥώμη ἐπὶ Πομπηιοῦ τοῦ Μεγάλου.</note> Dionysius
afterwards went to Rome, where he taught
about the time of Pompey. Now here we see a new
feature in the history of mankind. A Greek, a pupil
of Aristarchus, settles at Rome, and writes a practical
grammar of the Greek language&mdash;of course, for the
benefit of his young Roman pupils. He was not the
inventor of grammatical science. Nearly all the framework
of grammar, as we saw, was supplied to him
through the labors of his predecessors from Plato to
<pb n='101'/><anchor id='Pg101'/>
Aristarchus. But he was the first who applied the results
of former philosophers and critics to the practical
purpose of teaching Greek; and, what is most important,
of teaching Greek not to Greeks, who knew
Greek and only wanted the theory of their language,
but to Romans who had to be taught the declensions
and conjugations, regular and irregular. His work
thus became one of the principal channels through
which the grammatical terminology, which had been
carried from Athens to Alexandria, flowed back to
Rome, to spread from thence over the whole civilized
world.
</p>

<p>
Dionysius, however, though the author of the first
practical grammar, was by no means the first <q><emph>professeur
de langue</emph></q> who settled at Rome. At his
time Greek was more generally spoken at Rome than
French is now spoken in London. The children of
gentlemen learnt Greek before they learnt Latin, and
though Quintilian in his work on education does not
approve of a boy learning nothing but Greek for any
length of time, <q>as is now the fashion,</q> he says, <q>with
most people,</q> yet he too recommends that a boy should
be taught Greek first, and Latin
afterwards.<note place='foot'>Quintilian, i. 1, 12.</note> This
may seem strange, but the fact is that as long as we
know anything of Italy, the Greek language was as
much at home there as Latin. Italy owed almost
everything to Greece, not only in later days when the
setting sun of Greek civilization mingled its rays with
the dawn of Roman greatness; but ever since the first
Greek colonists started Westward Ho! in search of
new homes. It was from the Greeks that the Italians
received their alphabet and were taught to read and to
<pb n='102'/><anchor id='Pg102'/>
write.<note place='foot'>See Mommsen, Römische Geschichte, b. i. s. 197. <q>The

Italy by the Phocæans.</note> not excepting <emph>nausea</emph> or
sea-sickness, are all borrowed from Greek, and show
the extent to which the Italians were indebted to the
Greeks for the very rudiments of civilization. The
Italians, no doubt, had their own national gods, but
they soon became converts to the mythology of the
Greeks. Some of the Greek gods they identified with
their own; others they admitted as new deities. Thus
<emph>Saturnus</emph>, originally an Italian harvest god, was identified
with the Greek <emph>Kronos</emph>, and as <emph>Kronos</emph> was the
son of <emph>Uranos</emph>, a new deity was invented, and <emph>Saturnus</emph>
was fabled to be the son of <emph>Cœlus</emph>. Thus the Italian
<emph>Herculus</emph>, the god of hurdles, enclosures, and walls, was
merged in the Greek <emph>Heracles</emph>.<note place='foot'>Mommsen,
i. 154.</note> <emph>Castor</emph> and <emph>Pollux</emph>,
both of purely Greek origin, were readily believed in
as nautical deities by the Italian sailors, and they were
the first Greek gods to whom, after the battle on the
Lake Regillus (485), a temple was erected at Rome.<note place='foot'>Ibid. i. 408.</note>
In 431 another temple was erected at Rome to Apollo,
whose oracle at Delphi had been consulted by Italians
<pb n='103'/><anchor id='Pg103'/>
ever since Greek colonists had settled on their soil.
The oracles of the famous Sibylla of Cumæ were
written in Greek,<note place='foot'>Mommsen, i. 165.</note>
and the priests (duoviri sacris
faciundis) were allowed to keep two Greek slaves
for the purpose of translating these oracles.<note place='foot'><emph>Sibylla</emph>,
or <emph>sibulla</emph>, is a diminutive of an Italian <emph>sabus</emph> or

<p>
When the Romans, in 454 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, wanted to establish
a code of laws, the first thing they did was to send
commissioners to Greece to report on the laws of
Solon at Athens and the laws of other Greek
towns.<note place='foot'>Mommsen, i. 256.</note>
As Rome rose in political power, Greek manners,
Greek art, Greek language and literature found ready
admittance.<note place='foot'>Ibid. i. 425, 444.</note>
Before the beginning of the Punic wars,
many of the Roman statesmen were able to understand,
and even to speak Greek. Boys were not
only taught the Roman letters by their masters, the
<emph>literatores</emph>, but they had to learn at the same time
the Greek alphabet. Those who taught Greek at
Rome were then called <emph>grammatici</emph>, and they were
mostly Greek slaves or <emph>liberti</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Among the young men whom Cato saw growing
up at Rome, to know Greek was the same as to be a
gentleman. They read Greek books, they conversed
in Greek, they even wrote in Greek. Tiberius Gracchus,
consul in 177, made a speech in Greek at
Rhodes, which he afterwards published.<note place='foot'>Ibid. i. 857.</note> Flaminius,
when addressed by the Greeks in Latin, returned the
compliment by writing Greek verses in honor of their
<pb n='104'/><anchor id='Pg104'/>
gods. The first history of Rome was written at Rome
in Greek, by Fabius Pictor,<note place='foot'>Mommsen,
i. 902.</note> about 200 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>; and it
was probably in opposition to this work, and to those
of Lucius Cincius Alimentus, and Publius Scipio, that
Cato wrote his own history of Rome in Latin. The
example of the higher classes was eagerly followed by
the lowest. The plays of Plautus are the best proof;
for the affectation of using Greek words is as evident
in some of his characters as the foolish display of
French in the German writers of the eighteenth century.
There was both loss and gain in the inheritance
which Rome received from Greece; but what would
Rome have been without her Greek masters? The
very fathers of Roman literature were Greeks, private
teachers, men who made a living by translating
school-books and plays. Livius Andronicus, sent as
prisoner of war from Tarentum (272 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>), established
himself at Rome as professor of Greek. His
translation of the Odyssey into Latin verse, which
marks the beginning of Roman literature, was evidently
written by him for the use of his private
classes. His style, though clumsy and wooden in the
extreme, was looked upon as a model of perfection by
the rising poets of the capital. Nævius and Plautus
were his cotemporaries and immediate successors.
All the plays of Plautus were translations and adaptations
of Greek originals; and Plautus was not even
allowed to transfer the scene from Greece to Rome.
The Roman public wanted to see Greek life and
Greek depravity; it would have stoned the poet who
had ventured to bring on the stage a Roman patrician
or a Roman matron. Greek tragedies, also, were
<pb n='105'/><anchor id='Pg105'/>
translated into Latin. Ennius, the cotemporary of
Nævius and Plautus, though somewhat younger (239-169),
was the first to translate Euripides. Ennius,
like Andronicus, was an Italian Greek, who settled
at Rome as a teacher of languages and translator of
Greek. He was patronized by the liberal party, by
Publius Scipio, Titus Flaminius, and Marcus Fulvius
Nobilior.<note place='foot'>Mommsen, i. 892.</note> He became a Roman citizen. But Ennius
was more than a poet, more than a teacher of languages.
He has been called a neologian, and to a
certain extent he deserved that name. Two works
written in the most hostile spirit against the religion
of Greece, and against the very existence of the Greek
gods, were translated by him into Latin.<note place='foot'>Ibid.
i. 843, 194.</note> One was the philosophy of
<hi rend='italic'>Epicharmus</hi> (470 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, in Megara),
who taught that Zeus was nothing but the air, and
other gods but names of the powers of nature; the
other the work of <hi rend='italic'>Euhemerus</hi>,
of Messene (300 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>),
who proved, in the form of a novel, that the Greek
gods had never existed, and that those who were believed
in as gods had been men. These two works
were not translated without a purpose; and though
themselves shallow in the extreme, they proved destructive
to the still shallower systems of Roman
theology. Greek became synonymous with infidel;
and Ennius would hardly have escaped the punishment
inflicted on Nævius for his political satires, had
he not enjoyed the patronage and esteem of the most
influential statesmen at Rome. Even Cato, the stubborn
enemy of Greek philosophy<note place='foot'>Ibid. i. 911.</note> and rhetoric, was a
friend of the dangerous Ennius; and such was the
growing influence of Greek at Rome, that Cato himself
<pb n='106'/><anchor id='Pg106'/>
had to learn it in his old age, in order to teach his
boy what he considered, if not useful, at least harmless
in Greek literature. It has been the custom to laugh
at Cato for his dogged opposition to everything Greek;
but there was much truth in his denunciations. We
have heard much of young Bengál&mdash;young Hindus
who read Byron and Voltaire, play at billiards, drive
tandems, laugh at their priests, patronize missionaries,
and believe nothing. The description which Cato
gives of the young idlers at Rome reminds us very
much of young Bengál.
</p>

<p>
When Rome took the torch of knowledge from the
dying hands of Greece, that torch was not burning
with its brightest light. Plato and Aristotle had been
succeeded by Chrysippus and Carneades; Euripides
and Menander had taken the place of Æschylus and
Sophocles. In becoming the guardian of the Promethean
spark first lighted in Greece, and intended hereafter
to illuminate not only Italy, but every country
of Europe, Rome lost much of that native virtue to
which she owed her greatness. Roman frugality and
gravity, Roman citizenship and patriotism, Roman
purity and piety, were driven away by Greek luxury
and levity, Greek intriguing and self-seeking, Greek
vice and infidelity. Restrictions and anathemas were
of no avail; and Greek ideas were never so attractive
as when they had been reprobated by Cato and his
friends. Every new generation became more and more
impregnated with Greek. In 131<note place='foot'>Mommsen, ii. 407.</note> we hear of a
consul (Publius Crassus) who, like another Mezzofanti, was
able to converse in the various dialects of Greek.
Sulla allowed foreign ambassadors to speak Greek
<pb n='107'/><anchor id='Pg107'/>
before the Roman senate.<note place='foot'>Mommsen, ii. 410.</note> The Stoic philosopher
Panætius<note place='foot'>Ibid. ii. 408.</note> lived in the house of the Scipios, which
was for a long time the rendezvous of all the literary
celebrities at Rome. Here the Greek historian Polybius,
and the philosopher Cleitomachus, Lucilius the
satirist, Terence the African poet (196-159), and the
improvisatore Archias (102 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>), were welcome
guests.<note place='foot'>Ibid. ii. 437, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi>;
ii. 430.</note> In this select circle the master-works of Greek
literature were read and criticised; the problems of
Greek philosophy were discussed; and the highest interests
of human life became the subject of thoughtful
conversation. Though no poet of original genius
arose from this society, it exercised a most powerful
influence on the progress of Roman literature. It
formed a tribunal of good taste; and much of the
correctness, simplicity, and manliness of the classical
Latin is due to that <q>Cosmopolitan Club,</q> which
met under the hospitable roof of the Scipios.
</p>

<p>
The religious life of Roman society at the close of
the Punic wars was more Greek than Roman. All
who had learnt to think seriously on religious questions
were either Stoics or followers of Epicurus; or
they embraced the doctrines of the New Academy,
denying the possibility of any knowledge of the Infinite,
and putting opinion in the place of
truth.<note place='foot'>Zeno died 263; Epicurus died 270; Arcesilaus died 241; Carneades
died 129.</note>
Though the doctrines of Epicurus and the New Academy
were always considered dangerous and heretical,
the philosophy of the Stoics was tolerated, and a kind
of compromise effected between philosophy and religion.
There was a state-philosophy as well as a state-religion.
<pb n='108'/><anchor id='Pg108'/>
The Roman priesthood, though they had
succeeded, in 161, in getting all Greek rhetors and
philosophers expelled from Rome, perceived that a
compromise was necessary. It was openly avowed
that in the enlightened classes<note place='foot'>Mommsen,
ii. 417, 418.</note> philosophy must take
the place of religion, but that a belief in miracles and
oracles was necessary for keeping the large masses
in order. Even Cato,<note place='foot'>Ibid. i. 845.</note> the leader of the orthodox,
national, and conservative party, expressed his surprise
that a haruspex, when meeting a colleague, did not
burst out laughing. Men like Scipio Æmilianus and
Lælius professed to believe in the popular gods; but
with them Jupiter was the soul of the universe, the
statues of the gods mere works of art.<note place='foot'>Ibid. ii. 415, 417.</note> Their
gods, as the people complained, had neither body, parts,
nor passions. Peace, however, was preserved between
the Stoic philosopher and the orthodox priest. Both
parties professed to believe in the same gods, but they
claimed the liberty to believe in them in their own
way.
</p>

<p>
I have dwelt at some length on the changes in the
intellectual atmosphere of Rome at the end of the
Punic wars, and I have endeavored to show how
completely it was impregnated with Greek ideas in
order to explain, what otherwise would seem almost
inexplicable, the zeal and earnestness with which the
study of Greek grammar was taken up at Rome, not
only by a few scholars and philosophers, but by the
leading statesmen of the time. To our minds, discussions
on nouns and verbs, on cases and gender, on
regular and irregular conjugation, retain always something
of the tedious character which these subjects
<pb n='109'/><anchor id='Pg109'/>
had at school, and we can hardly understand how at
Rome, grammar&mdash;pure and simple grammar&mdash;should
have formed a subject of general interest, and a topic of
fashionable conversation. When one of the first grammarians
of the day, Crates of Pergamus, was sent to
Rome as ambassador of King Attalus, he was received
with the greatest distinction by all the literary statesmen
of the capital. It so happened that when walking
one day on the Palatian hill, Crates caught his foot in
the grating of a sewer, fell and broke his leg. Being
thereby detained at Rome longer than he intended, he
was persuaded to give some public lectures, or <emph>akroaseis</emph>,
on grammar; and from these lectures, says Suetonius,
dates the study of grammar at Rome. This took place
about 159 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, between the second and third Punic
wars, shortly after the death of Ennius, and two years
after the famous expulsion of the Greek rhetors and
philosophers (161). Four years later Carneades, likewise
sent to Rome as ambassador, was prohibited from
lecturing by Cato. After these lectures of Crates,
grammatical and philological studies became extremely
popular at Rome. We hear of Lucius Ælius Stilo,<note place='foot'>Mommsen,
ii. 413, 426, 445, 457. Lucius Ælius Stilo wrote a work on
etymology, and an index to Plautus.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Lersch</hi>,
<hi rend='italic'>Die Sprachphilosophie der
Alten</hi>, ii. 111.</note>
who lectured on Latin as Crates had lectured on Greek.
Among his pupils were Varro, Lucilius, and Cicero.
Varro composed twenty-four books on the Latin language,
four of which were dedicated to Cicero. Cicero,
himself, is quoted as an authority on grammatical questions,
though we know of no special work of his on
grammar. Lucilius devoted the ninth book of his
satires to the reform of spelling.<note place='foot'>Lersch,
ii. 113, 114, 143.</note> But nothing shows
<pb n='110'/><anchor id='Pg110'/>
more clearly the wide interest which grammatical studies
had then excited in the foremost ranks of Roman
society than Cæsar's work on Latin grammar. It was
composed by him during the Gallic war, and dedicated
to Cicero, who might well be proud of the compliment
thus paid him by the great general and statesman.
Most of these works are lost to us, and we can judge
of them only by means of casual quotations. Thus we
learn from a fragment of Cæsar's work, <hi rend='italic'>De analogia</hi>,
that he was the inventor of the term <emph>ablative</emph> in Latin.
The word never occurs before, and, of course, could
not be borrowed, like the names of the other cases,
from Greek grammarians, as they admitted no ablative
in Greek. To think of Cæsar fighting the barbarians
of Gaul and Germany, and watching from a distance
the political complications at Rome, ready to grasp the
sceptre of the world, and at the same time carrying on
his philological and grammatical studies together with
his secretary, the Greek Didymus,<note place='foot'>Lersch, iii. 144.</note> gives us a
new view both of that extraordinary man, and of the time in
which he lived. After Cæsar had triumphed, one of
his favorite plans was to found a Greek and Latin library
at Rome, and he offered the librarianship to the
best scholar of the day, to Varro, though Varro had
fought against him on the side of Pompey.<note place='foot'>Mommsen,
iii. 557. 48 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>
We have thus arrived at the time when, as we saw
in an earlier part of this lecture, Dionysius Thrax published
the first elementary grammar of Greek at Rome.
Empirical grammar had thus been transplanted to Rome,
the Greek grammatical terminology was translated into
Latin, and in this new Latin garb it has travelled now for
nearly two thousand years over the whole civilized world.
<pb n='111'/><anchor id='Pg111'/>
Even in India, where a different terminology had grown
up in the grammatical schools of the Brahmans, a terminology
in some respects more perfect than that of
Alexandria and Rome, we may now hear such words
as <emph>case</emph>, and <emph>gender</emph>,
and <emph>active</emph> and <emph>passive</emph>, explained by
European teachers to their native pupils. The fates of
words are curious indeed, and when I looked the other
day at some of the examination papers of the government
schools in India, such questions as&mdash;<q>Write the
genitive case of Siva,</q> seemed to reduce whole volumes
of history into a single sentence. How did these words,
genitive case, come to India? They came from England,
they had come to England from Rome, to Rome
from Alexandria, to Alexandria from Athens. At
Athens, the term <emph>case</emph>, or <emph>ptōsis</emph>, had a philosophical
meaning; at Rome, <emph>casus</emph> was merely a literal translation;
the original meaning of <emph>fall</emph> was lost, and the
word dwindled down to a mere technical term. At
Athens, the philosophy of language was a counterpart
of the philosophy of the mind. The terminology of
formal logic and formal grammar was the same. The
logic of the Stoics was divided into two
parts,<note place='foot'>Lersch, ii. 25. Περὶ σημαινόντων, or περὶ φώνης; and
περὶ σημαινομένον,
or περὶ πραγμάτων.</note> called
<emph>rhetoric</emph> and <emph>dialectic</emph>, and the latter treated, first, <q>On
that which signifies, or language;</q> secondly, <q>On that
which is signified, or things.</q> In their philosophical
language <emph>ptōsis</emph>, which the Romans translated by <emph>casus</emph>,
really meant fall; that is to say, the inclination or relation
of one idea to another, the falling or resting of
one word on another. Long and angry discussions were
carried on as to whether the name of <emph>ptōsis</emph>, or fall, was
applicable to the nominative; and every true Stoic
<pb n='112'/><anchor id='Pg112'/>
would have scouted the expression of <emph>casus rectus</emph>, because
the subject or the nominative, as they argued, did
not fall or rest on anything else, but stood erect, the
other words of a sentence leaning or depending on it.
All this is lost to us when we speak of cases.
</p>

<p>
And how are the dark scholars in the government
schools of India to guess the meaning of <emph>genitive</emph>? The
Latin <emph>genitivus</emph> is a mere blunder, for the Greek word
<emph>genikē</emph> could never mean <emph>genitivus</emph>. <emph>Genitivus</emph>, if
it is meant to express the case of origin or birth, would in
Greek have been called <emph>gennētikē</emph>, not <emph>genikē</emph>. Nor does
the genitive express the relation of son to father. For
though we may say, <q>the son of the father,</q> we may
likewise say, <q>the father of the son.</q> <emph>Genikē</emph>, in Greek,
had a much wider, a much more philosophical meaning.<note place='foot'>Beiträge
zur Geschichte der Grammatik, von Dr. K. E. A. Schmidt.
Halle, 1859. Uber den Begriff der γενικὴ πτῶσις, s. 320.</note>
It meant <emph>casus generalis</emph>, the general case, or
rather the case which expresses the gentus or kind.
This is the real power of the genitive. If I say, <q>a
bird of the water,</q> <q>of the water</q> defines the genus
to which a certain bird belongs; it refers it to the genus
of water-birds. <q>Man of the mountains,</q> means a
mountaineer. In phrases such as <q>son of the father,</q>
or <q>father of the son,</q> the genitives have the same
effect. They predicate something of the son or of the
father; and if we distinguished between the sons of
the father, and the sons of the mother, the genitives
would mark the class or genus to which the sons respectively
belonged. They would answer the same purpose
as the adjectives, paternal and maternal. It can
be proved etymologically that the termination of the
genitive is, in most cases, identical with those derivative
<pb n='113'/><anchor id='Pg113'/>
suffixes by which substantives are changed into adjectives.<note place='foot'>In
the Tibetan languages the rule is, <q>Adjectives are formed from substantives
by the addition of the genitive sign,</q> which might be inverted
into, <q>The genitive is formed from the nominative by the addition of the
adjective sign.</q> For instance, <emph>shing</emph>,
wood; <emph>shing gi</emph>, of wood, or wooden:
<emph>ser</emph>, gold; <emph>ser-gyi</emph>, of gold,
or golden: <emph>mi</emph>, man; <emph>mi-yi</emph>, of man, or human.
The same in Garo, where the sign of the genitive
is <emph>ni</emph>, we have; <emph>mánde-ní
jak</emph>, the hand of man, or the human hand; <emph>ambal-ní ketháli</emph>, a wooden
knife, or a knife of wood. In Hindustání the genitive is so clearly an adjective,
that it actually takes the marks of gender according to the words to which
it refers. But how is it in Sanskrit and Greek? In Sanskrit we may form
adjectives by the addition of <emph>tya</emph>.
(Turanian Languages, p. 41, <hi rend='italic'>seq.</hi>; Essay
on Bengálí, p. 333.) For instance, <emph>dakshiņâ</emph>,
south; <emph>dakshiņâ-tya</emph>, southern.
This <emph>tya</emph> is clearly a demonstrative pronoun,
the same as the Sanskrit <emph>syas</emph>,
<emph>syâ</emph>, <emph>tyad</emph>, this or that.
<emph>Tya</emph> is a pronominal base, and therefore such adjectives
as <emph>dakshiņâ-tya</emph>, southern, or
<emph>âp-tya</emph>, aquatic, from <emph>âp</emph>, water, must have
been conceived originally as <q>water-there,</q> or <q>south-there.</q> Followed
by the terminations of the nominative singular, which was again an original
pronoun, <emph>âptyas</emph> would mean <emph>âp-tya-s</emph>,
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, water-there-he. Now, it
makes little difference whether I say an aquatic bird or a bird of the water.
In Sanskrit the genitive of water would be, if we
take <emph>udaka</emph>, <emph>udaka-sya</emph>.
This <emph>sya</emph> is the same pronominal base as
the adjective termination <emph>tya</emph>, only
that the former takes no sign for the gender, like the adjective. The genitive
<emph>udakasya</emph> is therefore the same as an adjective without gender. Now
let us look to Greek. We there form adjectives by σιος, which is the same
as the Sanskrit <emph>tya</emph> or <emph>sya</emph>. For instance, from
δῆμος, people, the Greeks
formed δημόσιος, belonging to the people. Here ος, α, ον, mark the gender.
Leave the gender out, and you get δημοσιο. Now, there is a rule in Greek
that an ς between two vowels, in grammatical terminations, is elided. Thus
the genitive of γένος is not γένεσος, but γένεος, or γένους;
hence δημόσιο
would necessarily become δήμοιο. And what is δήμοιο but the regular
Homeric genitive of δῆμος, which in later Greek was replaced by δήμου?
Thus we see that the same principles which governed the formation of adjectives
and genitives in Tibetan, in Garo, and Hindustání, were at work
in the primitive stages of Sanskrit and Greek; and we perceive how accurately
the real power of the genitive was determined by the ancient Greek
grammarians, who called it the general or predicative case, whereas the
Romans spoiled the term by wrongly translating it into <emph>genitivus</emph>.</note>
</p>

<p>
It is hardly necessary to trace the history of what I
call the empirical study, or the grammatical analysis of
language, beyond Rome. With Dionysius Thrax the
<pb n='114'/><anchor id='Pg114'/>
framework of grammar was finished. Later writers
have improved and completed it, but they have added
nothing really new and original. We can follow the
stream of grammatical science from Dionysius Thrax to
our own time in an almost uninterrupted chain of
Greek and Roman writers. We find Quintilian in the
first century; Scaurus, Apollonius Dyscolus, and his son,
Herodianus, in the second; Probus and Donatus in the
fourth. After Constantine had moved the seat of government
from Rome, grammatical science received a new
home in the academy of Constantinople. There were no
less than twenty Greek and Latin grammarians who
held professorships at Constantinople. Under Justinian,
in the sixth century, the name of Priscianus gave
a new lustre to grammatical studies, and his work remained
an authority during the Middle Ages to nearly
our own times. We ourselves have been taught grammar
according to the plan which was followed by
Dionysius at Rome, by Priscianus at Constantinople,
by Alcuin at York; and whatever may be said of the
improvements introduced into our system of education,
the Greek and Latin grammars used at our public
schools are mainly founded on the first empirical analysis
of language, prepared by the philosophers of Athens,
applied by the scholars of Alexandria, and transferred
to the practical purpose of teaching a foreign tongue by
the Greek professors at Rome.

<head>Lecture IV. The Classificatory Stage.</head>

<p>
We traced, in our last lecture, the origin and progress
of the empirical study of languages from the time
of Plato and Aristotle to our own school-boy days.
We saw at what time, and under what circumstances,
the first grammatical analysis of language took place;
how its component parts, the parts of speech, were
named, and how, with the aid of a terminology, half
philosophical and half empirical, a system of teaching
languages was established, which, whatever we may
think of its intrinsic value, has certainly answered that
purpose for which it was chiefly intended.
</p>

<p>
Considering the process by which this system of
grammatical science was elaborated, it could not be
expected to give us an insight into the nature of language.
The division into nouns and verbs, articles
and conjunctions, the schemes of declension and conjugation,
were a merely artificial network thrown over
the living body of language. We must not look in the
grammar of Dionysius Thrax for a correct and well-articulated
skeleton of human speech. It is curious,
however, to observe the striking coincidences between
the grammatical terminology of the Greeks and the
Hindús, which would seem to prove that there must
be some true and natural foundation for the much-abused
<pb n='116'/><anchor id='Pg116'/>
grammatical system of the schools. The Hindús
are the only nation that cultivated the science of
grammar without having received any impulse, directly
or indirectly, from the Greeks. Yet we find in Sanskrit
too the same system of cases, called <hi rend='italic'>vibhakti</hi>, or
inflections, the active, passive, and middle voices, the
tenses, moods, and persons, divided not exactly, but
very nearly, in the same manner as in Greek.<note place='foot'>See
M. M.'s History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 158.</note> In
Sanskrit, grammar is called <hi rend='italic'>vyâkaraņa</hi>, which means
analysis or taking to pieces. As Greek grammar owed
its origin to the critical study of Homer, Sanskrit
grammar arose from the study of the Vedas, the most
ancient poetry of the Brahmans. The differences between
the dialect of these sacred hymns and the literary
Sanskrit of later ages were noted and preserved
with a religious care. We still possess the first essays
in the grammatical science of the Brahmans, the so-called
<hi rend='italic'>prâtiśâkhyas</hi>. These works, though they merely
profess to give rules on the proper pronunciation of the
ancient dialect of the Vedas, furnish us at the same
time with observations of a grammatical character, and
particularly with those valuable lists of words, irregular
or in any other way remarkable, the Gaņas. These
supplied that solid basis on which successive generations
of scholars erected the astounding structure
that reached its perfection in the grammar of Pâņini.
There is no form, regular or irregular, in the whole
Sanskrit language, which is not provided for in the
grammar of Pâņini and his commentators. It is the
perfection of a merely empirical analysis of language,
unsurpassed, nay even unapproached, by anything in
the grammatical literature of other nations. Yet of
<pb n='117'/><anchor id='Pg117'/>
the real nature, and natural growth of language, it
teaches us nothing.
</p>

<p>
What then do we know of language after we have
learnt the grammar of Greek or Sanskrit, or after we
have transferred the network of classical grammar to
our own tongue?
</p>

<p>
We know certain forms of language which correspond
to certain forms of thought. We know that
the subject must assume the form of the nominative,
the object that of the accusative. We know that the
more remote object may be put in the dative, and that
the predicate, in its most general form, may be rendered
by the genitive. We are taught that whereas in English
the genitive is marked by a final <emph>s</emph>, or by the preposition
<emph>of</emph>, it is in Greek expressed by a final ος, in
Latin by <emph>is</emph>. But what this ος and <emph>is</emph> represent, why
they should have the power of changing a nominative
into a genitive, a subject into a predicate, remains a
riddle. It is self-evident that each language, in order
to be a language, must be able to distinguish the subject
from the object, the nominative from the accusative.
But how a mere change of termination should
suffice to convey so material a distinction would seem
almost incomprehensible. If we look for a moment
beyond Greek and Latin, we see that there are in
reality but few languages which have distinct forms
for these two categories of thought. Even in Greek
and Latin there is no outward distinction between the
nominative and accusative of neuters. The Chinese
language, it is commonly said, has no grammar at all,
that is to say, it has no inflections, no declension and
conjugation, in our sense of these words; it makes no
formal distinction of the various parts of speech, noun,
<pb n='118'/><anchor id='Pg118'/>
verb, adjective, adverb, &amp;c. Yet there is no shade of
thought that cannot be rendered in Chinese. The
Chinese have no more difficulty in distinguishing between
<q>James beats John,</q> and <q>John beats James,</q>
than the Greeks and Romans or we ourselves. They
have no termination for the accusative, but they attain
the same by always placing the subject before, and the
object after the verb, or by employing words, before or
after the noun, which clearly indicate that it is to be
taken as the object of the verb.<note place='foot'><p>
The following and some other notes were kindly sent to me by the
first Chinese scholar in Europe, M. Stanislas Julien, Membre de l'Institut.
</p>
<p>
The Chinese do not decline their substantives, but they indicate the cases
distinctly&mdash;
</p>
<p>
A. By means of particles.<lb/>
B. By means of position.<lb/>
</p>
<p>
1. The nominative or the subject of a sentence is always placed at the
beginning.
</p>
<p>
2. The genitive may be marked&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) By the particle <emph>tchi</emph>
placed between the two nouns, of which the first
is in the genitive, the second in the nominative. Example, <emph>jin tchi kiun</emph>
(hominum princeps, literally, man, sign of the genitive, prince.)
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) By position, placing the word which is in the genitive first,
and the word which is in the nominative second. Ex. <emph>koue</emph> (kingdom)
<emph>jin</emph> (man) <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, a man of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>
3. The dative may be expressed&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) By the preposition <emph>yu</emph>, to. Ex.
<emph>sse</emph> (to give) <emph>yen</emph> (money) <emph>yu</emph> (to) <emph>jin</emph>
(man).
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) By position, placing first the verb, then the word which
stands in the dative, lastly, the word which stands in the accusative. Ex.
<emph>yu</emph> (to give) <emph>jin</emph> (to a man) <emph>pe</emph> (white)
<emph>yu</emph> (jade), <emph>hoang</emph> (yellow) <emph>kin</emph> (metal),
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, gold.
</p>
<p>
4. The accusative is either left without any mark, for instance, <emph>pao</emph> (to
protect) <emph>min</emph> (the people), or it is preceded by certain words which had
originally a more tangible meaning, but gradually dwindled away into
mere signs of the accusative. [These were first discovered and correctly
explained by M. Stanislas Julien in his Vindiciæ Philologicæ in Linguam
Sinicam, Paris, 1830.] The particles most frequently used for this purpose
by modern writers are <emph>pa</emph> and <emph>tsiang</emph>, to grasp, to take. Ex.
<emph>pa</emph> (taking) <emph>tchoung-jin</emph> (crowd of men) <emph>t'eou</emph>
(secretly) <emph>k'an</emph> (he looked) <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, he looked
secretly at the crowd of men (hominum turbam furtim aspiciebat). In the
more ancient Chinese (<emph>Kouwen</emph>) the words used for the same purpose are
<emph>i</emph> (to employ, etc.), <emph>iu</emph>, <emph>iu</emph>, <emph>hou</emph>.
Ex. <emph>i</emph> (employing) <emph>jin</emph> (mankind) <emph>t'sun</emph> (he
preserves) <emph>sin</emph> (in the heart), <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, humanitatem
conservat corde. <emph>I</emph> (taking) <emph>tchi</emph> (right) <emph>wêï</emph>
(to make) <emph>k'iŏ</emph> (crooked), <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, rectum facere curvum.
<emph>Pao</emph> (to protect) <emph>hou</emph> (sign of accus.) <emph>min</emph>
(the people).
</p>
<p>
5. The ablative is expressed&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) By means of prepositions, such as <emph>thsong</emph>,
<emph>yeou</emph>, <emph>tsen</emph>, <emph>hou</emph>. Ex. <emph>thsong</emph>
(ex) <emph>thien</emph> (cœlo) <emph>laï</emph> (venire); <emph>te</emph> (obtinere)
<emph>hou</emph> (ab) <emph>thien</emph> (cœlo).
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) By means of position, so that the word in the ablative is
placed before the verb. Ex. <emph>thien</emph> (heaven) <emph>hiang-tchi</emph>
(descended, <emph>tchi</emph> being the relative particle or sign of the genitive)
<emph>tsaï</emph> (calamities), <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the calamities
which Heaven sends to men.
</p>
<p>
6. The instrumental is expressed&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) By the preposition <emph>yu</emph>, with. Ex.
<emph>yu</emph> (with) <emph>kien</emph> (the sword) <emph>cha</emph> (to
kill) <emph>jin</emph> (a man).
</p>
<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) By position, the substantive which stands in the instrumental
case being placed before the verb, which is followed again by the noun in the
accusative. Ex. <emph>i</emph> (by hanging) <emph>cha</emph> (he killed)
<emph>tchi</emph> (him).
</p>
<p>
7. The locative may be expressed by simply placing the noun before
the verb. Ex. <emph>si</emph> (in the East or East) <emph>yeou</emph>
(there is) <emph>suo-tou-po</emph> (a sthúpa);
or by prepositions as described in the text.
</p>
<p>
The adjective is always placed before the substantive to which it belongs.
Ex. <emph>meï jin</emph>, a beautiful woman.
</p>
<p>
The adverb is generally followed by a particle which produces the same
effect as <emph>e</emph> in bene, or <emph>ter</emph> in celeriter.
Ex. <emph>cho-jen</emph>, in silence, silently;
<emph>ngeou-jen</emph>, perchance; <emph>kiu-jen</emph>, with fear.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes an adjective becomes an adverb through position. Ex. <emph>chen</emph>,
good; but <emph>chen ko</emph>, to sing well.
</p></note> There are other languages
<pb n='119'/><anchor id='Pg119'/>
which have more terminations even than Greek
and Latin. In Finnish there are fifteen cases, expressive
of every possible relation between the subject and
the object; but there is no accusative, no purely objective
case. In English and French the distinctive
terminations of the nominative and accusative have
been worn off by phonetic corruption, and these languages
are obliged, like Chinese, to mark the subject
and object by the collocation of words. What we
learn therefore at school in being taught that <emph>rex</emph> in the
nominative becomes <emph>regem</emph> in the accusative, is simply
a practical rule. We know when to say <emph>rex</emph>, and when
to say <emph>regem</emph>. But why the king as a subject should
be called <emph>rex</emph>, and as an object <emph>regem</emph>, remains entirely
<pb n='120'/><anchor id='Pg120'/>
unexplained. In the same manner we learn that <emph>amo</emph>
means I love, <emph>amavi</emph> I loved; but why that tragical
change from <emph>love</emph> to <emph>no love</emph> should be represented by
the simple change of <emph>o</emph> to <emph>avi</emph>, or, in English, by the
addition of a mere <emph>d</emph>, is neither asked nor answered.
</p>

<p>
Now if there is a science of language, these are the
questions which it will have to answer. If they cannot
be answered, if we must be content with paradigms
and rules, if the terminations of nouns and verbs must
be looked upon either as conventional contrivances or
as mysterious excrescences, there is no such thing as a
science of language, and we must be satisfied with
what has been called the art (τέχνη) of language, or
grammar.
</p>

<p>
Before we either accept or decline the solution of
any problem, it is right to determine what means there
are for solving it. Beginning with English we should
ask, what means have we for finding out why <emph>I love</emph>
should mean I am actually loving, whereas <emph>I loved</emph> indicates
that that feeling is past and gone? Or, if we
look to languages richer in inflections than English,
by what process can we discover under what circumstances
<emph>amo</emph>, I love, was changed, through the mere addition
of an <emph>r</emph>, into <emph>amor</emph>, expressing no longer <emph>I love</emph>,
but <emph>I am loved</emph>? Did declensions and conjugations bud
forth like the blossoms of a tree? Were they imparted
to man ready made by some mysterious power? Or
did some wise people invent them, assigning certain
letters to certain phases of thought, as mathematicians
express unknown quantities by freely chosen algebraic
exponents? We are here brought at once face to face
with the highest and most difficult problem of our
science, the origin of language. But it will be well
<pb n='121'/><anchor id='Pg121'/>
for the present to turn our eyes away from theories,
and fix our attention at first entirely on facts.
</p>

<p>
Let us keep to the English perfect, <emph>I loved</emph>, as compared
with the present, <emph>I love</emph>. We cannot embrace at
once the whole English grammar, but if we can track
one form to its true lair, we shall probably have no
difficulty in digging out the rest of the brood. Now,
if we ask how the addition of a final <emph>d</emph> could express
the momentous transition from being in love to being
indifferent, the first thing we have to do, before attempting
any explanation, would be to establish the
earliest and most original form of <emph>I loved</emph>. This is a
rule which even Plato recognized in his philosophy of
language, though, we must confess, he seldom obeyed
it. We know what havoc phonetic corruption may
make both in the dictionary and the grammar of a
language, and it would be a pity to waste our conjectures
on formations which a mere reference to the history
of language would suffice to explain. Now a very
slight acquaintance with the history of the English
language teaches us that the grammar of modern English
is not the same as the grammar of Wycliffe.
Wycliffe's English again may be traced back to what,
with Sir Frederick Madden, we may call Middle
English, from 1500 to 1330; Middle English to Early
English, from 1330 to 1230; Early English to Semi-Saxon
from 1230 to 1100; and Semi-Saxon to Anglo-Saxon.<note place='foot'>See
some criticisms on this division in Marsh's Lectures on the
English Language, p. 48.</note>
It is evident that if we are to discover the
original intention of the syllable which changes <emph>I love</emph>
into <emph>I loved</emph>, we must consult the original form of that
syllable wherever we can find it. We should never
<pb n='122'/><anchor id='Pg122'/>
have known that <emph>priest</emph> meant originally <emph>an elder</emph>, unless
we had traced it back to its original form <emph>presbyter</emph>,
in which a Greek scholar at once recognizes the comparative
of <emph>presbys</emph>, old. If left to modern English
alone, we might attempt to connect <emph>priest</emph> with <emph>praying</emph>
or <emph>preaching</emph>, but we should not thus arrive at its true
derivation. The modern word <emph>Gospel</emph> conveys no
meaning at all. As soon as we trace it back to the
original <emph>Goddspell</emph>, we see that it is a literal translation
of <emph>Evangelium</emph>, or good news, good tidings.<note place='foot'><p>
<q>Goddspell onn Ennglissh nemmnedd iss<lb/>

</p>
<p>
<q>And beode þer godes godd-spel.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Layamon</hi>,
iii. 182, v. 29, 507.</p></note> <emph>Lord</emph>
would be nothing but an empty title in English, unless
we could discover its original form and meaning in the
Anglo-Saxon <emph>hlafford</emph>, meaning a giver of bread, from
<emph>hlaf</emph>, a loaf, and <emph>ford</emph>, to give.
</p>

<p>
But even after this is done, after we have traced a
modern English word back to Anglo-Saxon, it follows
by no means that we should there find it in its original
form, or that we should succeed in forcing it to disclose
its original intention. Anglo-Saxon is not an original
or aboriginal language. It points by its very name
to the Saxons and Angles of the continent. We
have, therefore, to follow our word from Anglo-Saxon
through the various Saxon and Low-German dialects,
till we arrive at last at the earliest stage of German
which is within our reach, the Gothic of the fourth
century after Christ. Even here we cannot rest. For,
although we cannot trace Gothic back to any earlier
Teutonic language, we see at once that Gothic, too,
is a modern language, and that it must have passed
<pb n='123'/><anchor id='Pg123'/>
through numerous phases of growth before it became
what it is in the mouth of Bishop Ulfilas.
</p>

<p>
What then are we to do?&mdash;We must try to do
what is done when we have to deal with the modern
Romance languages. If we could not trace a French
word back to Latin, we should look for its corresponding
form in Italian, and endeavor to trace the Italian
to its Latin source. If, for instance, we were doubtful
about the origin of the French word for fire, <emph>feu</emph>, we
have but to look to the Italian <emph>fuoco</emph>, in order to see at
once that both <emph>fuoco</emph> and <emph>feu</emph> are derived from the Latin
<emph>focus</emph>. We can do this, because we know that French
and Italian are cognate dialects, and because we have
ascertained beforehand the exact degree of relationship
in which they stand to each other. Had we, instead
of looking to Italian, looked to German for an explanation
of the French <emph>feu</emph>, we should have missed the
right track; for the German <emph>feuer</emph>, though more like
<emph>feu</emph> than the Italian <emph>fuoco</emph>, could never have assumed
in French the form <emph>feu</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Again, in the case of the preposition <emph>hors</emph>, which in
French means <emph>without</emph>, we can more easily determine
its origin after we have found that <emph>hors</emph> corresponds
with the Italian <emph>fuora</emph>, the Spanish <emph>fuera</emph>. The French
<emph>fromage</emph>, cheese, derives no light from Latin. But as
soon as we compare the Italian <emph>formaggio</emph>,<note place='foot'>Diez,
Lexicon Comparativum. Columella, vii. 8.</note> we see that
<emph>formaggio</emph> and <emph>fromage</emph> are derived from <emph>forma</emph>;
cheese being made in Italy by keeping the milk in small baskets
or forms. <emph>Feeble</emph>, the French <emph>faible</emph>, is clearly
derived from Latin; but it is not till we see the
Italian <emph>fievole</emph> that we are reminded of the Latin <emph>flebilis</emph>,
tearful. We should never have found the etymology,
<pb n='124'/><anchor id='Pg124'/>
that is to say the origin, of the French <emph>payer</emph>, the
English <emph>to pay</emph>, if we did not consult the dictionary
of the cognate dialects, such as Italian and Spanish.
Here we find that <emph>to pay</emph> is expressed in Italian by
<emph>pagare</emph>, in Spanish by <emph>pagar</emph>, whereas in Provençal
we actually find the two forms <emph>pagar</emph> and <emph>payar</emph>. Now
<emph>pagar</emph> clearly points back to Latin <emph>pacare</emph>, which means
<emph>to pacify</emph>, <emph>to appease</emph>. To appease a creditor meant to
pay him; in the same manner as <emph>une quittance</emph>, a quittance
or receipt, was originally <emph>quietantia</emph>, a quieting,
from <emph>quietus</emph>, quiet.
</p>

<p>
If, therefore, we wish to follow up our researches,&mdash;if,
not satisfied with having traced an English word
back to Gothic, we want to know what it was at a still
earlier period of its growth,&mdash;we must determine
whether there are any languages that stand to Gothic
in the same relation in which Italian and Spanish stand
to French;&mdash;we must restore, as far as possible, the
genealogical tree of the various families of human
speech. In doing this we enter on the second or
classificatory stage of our science; for genealogy,
where it is applicable, is the most perfect form of
classification.
</p>

<p>
Before we proceed to examine the results which
have been obtained by the recent labors of Schlegel,
Humboldt, Bopp, Burnouf, Pott, Benfey, Prichard,
Grimm, Kuhn, Curtius, and others in this branch of
the science of language, it will be well to glance at
what had been achieved before their time in the classification
of the numberless dialects of mankind.
</p>

<p>
The Greeks never thought of applying the principle
of classification to the varieties of human speech.
They only distinguished between Greek on one side,
<pb n='125'/><anchor id='Pg125'/>
and all other languages on the other, comprehended
under the convenient name of <q>Barbarous.</q> They
succeeded, indeed, in classifying four of their own
dialects with tolerable correctness,<note place='foot'>Strabo, viii. p.
833. Τὴν μὲν Ἰάδα τῇ παλαιᾷ Ἀτθίδι τὴν αὐτὴν φαμέν,
τὴν δὲ Δωρίδα τῇ Αἰολίδι.</note> but they applied
the term <q>barbarous</q> so promiscuously to the other
more distant relatives of Greek, (the dialects of the
Pelasgians, Carians, Macedonians, Thracians, and Illyrians,)
that, for the purposes of scientific classification,
it is almost impossible to make any use of the statements
of ancient writers about these so-called barbarous
idioms.<note place='foot'><p>Herodotus (vii. 94, 509) gives Pelasgi as the old name of
the Æolians and of the Ionians in the Peloponnesus and the islands. Nevertheless he
argues (i. 57), from the dialect spoken in his time by the Pelasgi of the
towns of Kreston, Plakia, and Skylake, that the old Pelasgi spoke a barbarous
tongue (βάρβαρον τὴν γλῶσσαν ἱέντες). He has, therefore, to admit
that the Attic race, being originally Pelasgic, unlearnt its language (τὸ
Ἀττικὸν ἔθνος ἐὸν Πελασγικόν, ἅμα τῇ μεταβόλη τῇ ἐς Ἕλληνας, καὶ τὴν
γλῶσσαν μετέμαθε). See Diefenbach, Origines Europææ, p. 59. Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (i. 17) avoids this difficulty by declaring the Pelasgi
to have been from the beginning a Hellenic race. This however, is
merely his own theory. The <emph>Karians</emph> are called βαρβαρόφωνοι by Homer
(II. v. 867); but Strabo (xiv. 662) takes particular care to show that they
are not therefore to be considered as βάρβαροι. He distinguishes between
βαρβαροφωνεῖν, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, κακῶς ἑλληνίζειν, and Καριστὶ λαλαεῖν,
καρίζειν καὶ βαρβαρίζειν. But the same Strabo says that the Karians were formerly
called Λέλεγεs (xii. p. 572); and these, together with Pelasgians and Kaukones,
are reckoned by him (vii. p. 321) as the earlier <emph>barbarous</emph> inhabitants
of Hellas. Again he (vii. p. 321), as well as Aristotle and Dionysius
of Halicarnassus (i. 17), considers the Locrians as descendants of the
Leleges, though they would hardly call the Locrians barbarians.
</p>
<p>
The <emph>Macedonians</emph> are mentioned by Strabo (x. p. 460) together with
<q>the other Hellenes.</q> Demosthenes speaks of Alexander as a barbarian;
Isokrates as a Heraclide. To judge from a few extant words, Macedonian
might have been a Greek dialect. (Diefenbach, Orig. Europ. p. 62.) Justine
(vii. 1) says of the Macedonians, <q>Populus Pelasgi, regio Pæonia dicebatur.</q>
There was a tradition that the country occupied by the Macedonians
belonged formerly to Thracians or Pierians (Thuc. ii. 99; Strabo, vii.
p. 321); part of it to Thessalians (ibid.).
</p>
<p>
The <emph>Thracians</emph> are called by Herodotus (v. 3) the greatest people after
the Indians. They are distinguished by Strabo from Illyrians (Diefenbach,
p. 65), from Celts (ibid.), and from Scythians (Thuc. ii. 96). What
we know of their language rests on a statement of Strabo (vii. 303, 305),
that the Thracians spoke the same language as the Getæ, and the Getæ the
same as the Dacians. We possess fragments of Dacian speech in the botanical
names collected by Dioskorides, and these, as interpreted by Grimm,
are clearly Aryan, though not Greek. The Dacians are called barbarians
by Strabo, together with Illyrians and Epirotes. (Strabo, vii. p. 321.)
</p>
<p>
The <emph>Illyrians</emph> were barbarians in the eyes of the Greeks. They are now
considered as an independent branch of the Aryan family. Herodotus
refers the Veneti to the Illyrians (i. 196); and the Veneti, according
to Polybius (ii. 17), who knew them, spoke a language different from
that of the Celts. He adds that they were an old race, and in their manner
and dress like the Celts. Hence many writers have mistaken them
for Celts, neglecting the criterion of language, on which Polybius lays
such proper stress. The Illyrians were a widely extended race; the Pannonians,
the Dalmatians, and the Dardanians (from whom the Dardanelles
were called), are all spoken of as Illyrians. (Diefenbach, Origines Europææ,
pp. 74, 75.) It is lost labor to try to extract anything positive from
the statements of the Greeks and Romans on the race and the language of
their barbarian neighbors.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n='126'/><anchor id='Pg126'/>

<p>
Plato, indeed, in his Cratylus (c. 36), throws out a
hint that the Greeks might have received their own
words from the barbarians, the barbarians being older
than the Greeks. But he was not able to see the full
bearing of this remark. He only points out that some
words, such as the names of <emph>fire</emph>,
<emph>water</emph>, and <emph>dog</emph>, were
the same in Phrygian and Greek; and he supposes that
the Greeks borrowed them from the Phrygians (c. 26).
The idea that the Greek language and that of the barbarians
could have had a common source never entered
his mind. It is strange that even so comprehensive a
mind as that of Aristotle should have failed to perceive
in languages some of that law and order which he
tried to discover in every realm of nature. As Aristotle,
however, did not attempt this, we need not wonder
that it was not attempted by any one else for the
next two thousand years. The Romans, in all scientific
<pb n='127'/><anchor id='Pg127'/>
matters, were merely the parrots of the Greeks.
Having themselves been called barbarians, they soon
learnt to apply the same name to all other nations,
except, of course, to their masters, the Greeks. Now
<emph>barbarian</emph> is one of those lazy expressions which seem
to say everything but in reality say nothing. It was
applied as recklessly as the word <emph>heretic</emph> during the
Middle Ages. If the Romans had not received this
convenient name of barbarian ready made for them,
they would have treated their neighbors, the Celts
and Germans, with more respect and sympathy: they
would, at all events, have looked at them with a more
discriminating eye. And, if they had done so, they
would have discovered, in spite of outward differences,
that these barbarians were, after all, not very
distant cousins. There was as much similarity between
the language of Cæsar and the barbarians
against whom he fought in Gaul and Germany as
there was between his language and that of Homer.
A man of Cæsar's sagacity would have seen this, if he
had not been blinded by traditional phraseology. I
am not exaggerating. For let us look at one instance
only. If we take a verb of such constant occurrence
as <emph>to have</emph>, we shall find the paradigms almost identical
in Latin and Gothic:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l>I have in Latin is habeo, in Gothic haba.</l>
<l>Thou hast in Latin is habes, in Gothic habais.</l>
<l>He has  in Latin is habet, in Gothic habaiþ.</l>
<l>We have in Latin is habemus, in Gothic habam.</l>
<l>You have  in Latin is habetis, in Gothic habaiþ.</l>
<l>They have in Latin is habent, in Gothic habant.</l>
</lg>

<p>
It surely required a certain amount of blindness, or
rather of deafness, not to perceive such similarity, and
<pb n='128'/><anchor id='Pg128'/>
that blindness or deafness arose, I believe, entirely from
the single word <emph>barbarian</emph>. Not till that word barbarian
was struck out of the dictionary of mankind, and
replaced by brother, not till the right of all nations of
the world to be classed as members of one genus or
kind was recognized, can we look even for the first
beginnings of our science. This change was effected
by Christianity. To the Hindú, every man not twice-born
was a Mlechha; to the Greek, every man not
speaking Greek was a barbarian; to the Jew, every
person not circumcised was a Gentile; to the Mohammedan,
every man not believing in the prophet is a
Giaur or Kaffir. It was Christianity which first broke
down the barriers between Jew and Gentile, between
Greek and barbarian, between the white and the black.
<emph>Humanity</emph> is a word which you look for in vain in Plato
or Aristotle; the idea of mankind as one family, as the
children of one God, is an idea of Christian growth;
and the science of mankind, and of the languages of
mankind, is a science which, without Christianity,
would never have sprung into life. When people
had been taught to look upon all men as brethren,
then, and then only, did the variety of human speech
present itself as a problem that called for a solution in
the eyes of thoughtful observers; and I, therefore, date
the real beginning of the science of language from the
first day of Pentecost. After that day of cloven
tongues a new light is spreading over the world, and
objects rise into view which had been hidden from the
eyes of the nations of antiquity. Old words assume a
new meaning, old problems a new interest, old sciences
a new purpose. The common origin of mankind, the
differences of race and language, the susceptibility of
<pb n='129'/><anchor id='Pg129'/>
all nations of the highest mental culture, these become,
in the new world in which we live, problems of scientific,
because of more than scientific, interest. It is no
valid objection that so many centuries should have
elapsed before the spirit which Christianity infused into
every branch of scientific inquiry produced visible results.
We see in the oaken fleet which rides the ocean
the small acorn which was buried in the ground hundreds
of years ago, and we recognize in the philosophy
of Albertus Magnus,<note place='foot'>Albert, Count of
Bollstädten, or, as he is more generally called, Albertus
Magnus, the pioneer of modern physical science, wrote: <q>God has
given to man His spirit, and with it also intellect, that man might use it
for to know God. And God is known through the soul and by faith from
the Bible, through the intellect from nature.</q> And again: <q>It is to the
praise and glory of God, and for the benefit of our brethren, that we study
the nature of created things. In all of them, not only in the harmonious
formation of every single creature, but likewise in the variety of different
forms, we can and we ought to admire the majesty and wisdom of God.</q></note>
though nearly 1200 years after the death of Christ, in the aspirations
of Kepler,<note place='foot'><p>These are the last words in Kepler's
<q>Harmony of the World,</q> <q>Thou
who by the light of nature hast kindled in us the longing after the light
of Thy grace, in order to raise us to the light of Thy glory, thanks to Thee,
Creator and Lord, that Thou lettest me rejoice in Thy works. Lo, I have
done the work of my life with that power of intellect which Thou hast
given. I have recorded to men the glory of Thy works, as far as my mind
could comprehend their infinite majesty. My senses were awake to search
as far as I could, with purity and faithfulness. If I, a worm before thine
eyes, and born in the bonds of sin, have brought forth anything that is
unworthy of Thy counsels, inspire me with Thy spirit, that I may correct
it. If, by the wonderful beauty of Thy works, I have been led into boldness,
if I have sought my own honor among men as I advanced in the
work which was destined to Thine honor, pardon me in kindness and charity,
and by Thy grace grant that my teaching may be to Thy glory, and
the welfare of all men. Praise ye the Lord, ye heavenly Harmonies, and
ye that understand the new harmonies, praise the Lord. Praise God, O my
soul, as long as I live. From Him, through Him, and in Him is all, the
material as well as the spiritual&mdash;all that we know and all that we know
not yet&mdash;for there is much to do that is yet undone.</q>
</p>
<p>
These words are all the more remarkable, because written by a man who
was persecuted by theologians as a heretic, but who nevertheless was not
ashamed to profess himself a Christian.
</p>
<p>
I end with an extract from one of the most distinguished of living
naturalists:&mdash;<q>The
antiquarian recognizes at once the workings of intelligence
in the remains of an ancient civilization. He may fail to ascertain their
age correctly, he may remain doubtful as to the order in which they were
successively constructed, but the character of the whole tells him they are
works of art, and that men like himself originated these relics of by-gone
ages. So shall the intelligent naturalist read at once in the pictures which
nature presents to him, the works of a higher Intelligence; he shall recognize
in the minute perforated cells of the coniferæ, which differ so wonderfully
from those of other plants, the hieroglyphics of a peculiar age; in
their needle-like leaves, the escutcheon of a peculiar dynasty; in their repeated
appearance under most diversified circumstances, a thoughtful and
thought-eliciting adaptation. He beholds, indeed, the works of a being
<emph>thinking</emph> like himself, but he feels, at the same time, that he stands as
much below the Supreme Intelligence, in wisdom, power, and goodness, as the works
of art are inferior to the wonders of nature. Let naturalists look at the
world under such impressions, and evidence will pour in upon us that all
creatures are expressions of the thoughts of Him whom we know, love,
and adore unseen.</q></p></note> and
in the researches of the greatest philosophers of our
own age, the sound of that key-note of thought which
had been struck for the first time by the apostle of the
<pb n='130'/><anchor id='Pg130'/>
Gentiles:<note place='foot'>Rom. i. 20.</note>
<q><emph>For the invisible things of Him from the
creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood
by the things that are made, even His eternal power and
Godhead</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
But we shall see that the science of language owes
more than its first impulse to Christianity. The pioneers
of our science were those very apostles who were
commanded <q>to go into all the world, and preach the
Gospel to every creature,</q> and their true successors, the
missionaries of the whole Christian Church. Translations
of the Lord's Prayer or of the Bible into every
dialect of the world, form even now the most valuable
materials for the comparative philologist. As long as
the number of known languages was small, the idea of
<pb n='131'/><anchor id='Pg131'/>
classification hardly suggested itself. The mind must
be bewildered by the multiplicity of facts before it has recourse
to division. As long as the only languages studied
were Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, the simple division
into sacred and profane, or classical and oriental, sufficed.
But when theologians extended their studies to Arabic,
Chaldee, and Syriac, a step, and a very important step,
was made towards the establishment of a class or family
of languages.<note place='foot'><p>Hervas (Catalogo, i. 37)
mentions the following works, published during
the sixteenth century, bearing on the science of language:&mdash;<q>Introductio
in Chaldaicam Linguam, Siriacam, atque Armenicam, et decem alias Linguas,</q>
a Theseo Ambrosio. Papiæ, 1539, 4to. <q>De Ratione communi
omnium Linguarum et Litterarum Commentarius,</q> a Theodoro Bibliandro.
Tiguri, 1548, 4to. It contains the Lord's Prayer in fourteen languages.
Bibliander derives Welsh and Cornish from Greek, Greek having been carried
there from Marseilles, through France. He states that Armenian
differs little from Chaldee, and cites Postel, who derived the Turks from the
Armenians, because Turkish was spoken in Armenia. He treats the Persians
as descendants of Shem, and connects their language with Syriac and
Hebrew. Servian and Georgian are, according to him, dialects of Greek.
</p>
<p>
Other works on language published during the sixteenth century are:&mdash;<q>Perion.
Dialogorum de Linguæ Gallicæ origine ejusque cum Græca cognatione,
libri quatuor.</q> Parisiis, 1554. He says that as French is not mentioned
among the seventy-two languages which sprang from the Tower of
Babel, it must be derived from Greek. He quotes Cæsar (de Bello Gallico,
vi. 14) to prove that the Druids spoke Greek, and then derives from it the
modern French language!
</p>
<p>
The works of Henri Estienne (1528-1598) stand on a much sounder basis.
He has been unjustly accused of having derived French from Greek. See
his <q>Traicté de la Conformité du Langage français avec le grec;</q> about
1566. It contains chiefly syntactical and grammatical remarks, and its object
is to show that modes of expression in Greek, which sound anomalous
and difficult, can be rendered easy by a comparison of analogous expressions
in French.
</p>
<p>
The Lord's Prayer was published in 1548 in fourteen languages, by
Bibliander; in 1591 in twenty-six languages, by Roccha (<q>Bibliotheca
Apostolica Vaticana,</q> a fratre Angelo Roccha: Romæ, 1591, 4to.); in 1592
in forty languages, by Megiserus (<q>Specimen XL. Linguarum et Dialectorum
ab Hieronymo Megisero à diversis auctoribus collectarum quibus
Oratio Dominica est expressa:</q> Francofurti, 1592); in 1593, in fifty languages,
by the same author (<q>Oratio Dominica L. diversis linguis,</q> cura H.
Megiseri: Francofurti, 1593, 8vo.).</p></note>
No one could help seeing that these languages
<pb n='132'/><anchor id='Pg132'/>
were most intimately related to each other, and
that they differed from Greek and Latin on all points
on which they agreed among themselves. As early as
1606 we find <hi rend='italic'>Guichard</hi>,<note place='foot'><p>At
the beginning of the seventeenth century was published <q>Trésor de
l'Histoire des Langues de cet Univers,</q> par Claude Duret; seconde edition:
Iverdon, 1619, 4to. Hervas says that Duret repeats the mistakes of Postel,
Bibliander, and other writers of the sixteenth century.
</p>
<p>
Before Duret came Estienne Guichard, <q>l'Harmonie Etymologique des
Langues Hebraique, Chaldaique, Syriaque&mdash;Greque&mdash;Latine, Françoise,
Italienne, Espagnole&mdash;Allemande, Flamende, Anglaise, &amp;c.:</q> Paris,
1606.
</p>
<p>
Hervas only knows the second edition, Paris, 1618, and thinks the first
was published in 1608. The title of his book shows that Guichard distinguished
between four classes of languages, which we should now call the
Semitic, the Hellenic, Italic, and Teutonic: he derives, however, Greek from
Hebrew.
</p>
<p>
I. I. Scaliger, in his <q>Diatriba de Europæorum Linguis</q> (Opuscula varia:
Parisiis, 1610), p. 119, distinguishes eleven classes: Latin, Greek, Teutonic,
Slavonic, Epirotic or Albanian, Tartaric, Hungarian, Finnic, Irish, British
in Wales and Brittany, and Bask or Cantabrian.</p></note>
in his <q>Harmonie Etymologique,</q>
placing Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac as a class
of languages by themselves, and distinguishing besides
between the Romance and Teutonic dialects.
</p>

<p>
What prevented, however, for a long time the progress
of the science of language was the idea that Hebrew
was the primitive language of mankind, and that,
therefore, all languages must be derived from Hebrew.
The fathers of the Church never expressed any doubt on
this point. St. Jerome, in one of his epistles to Damasus,<note place='foot'><q>Initium
oris et communis eloquii, et hoc omne quod loquimur, Hebræam
esse linguam qua vetus Testamentum scriptum est, universa antiquitas
tradidit.</q> In another place (Isaia, c. 7) he writes, <q>Omnium enim
fere linguarum verbis utuntur Hebræi.</q></note>
writes: <q>the whole of antiquity (universa antiquitas)
affirms that Hebrew, in which the Old Testament
is written, was the beginning of all human speech.</q>
Origen, in his eleventh Homily on the book of Numbers,
expresses his belief that the Hebrew language, originally
<pb n='133'/><anchor id='Pg133'/>
given through Adam, remained in that part of the
world which was the chosen portion of God, not left like
the rest to one of His angels.<note place='foot'><q>Mansit
lingua per Adam primitus data, ut putamus, Hebræa, in
ea parte hominum, quæ non pars alicujus angeli, sed quæ
Dei portio permansit.</q></note> When, therefore, the
first attempts at a classification of languages were made,
the problem, as it presented itself to scholars such as
Guichard and Thomassin, was this: <q>As Hebrew is
undoubtedly the mother of all languages, how are we to
explain the process by which Hebrew became split into
so many dialects, and how can these numerous dialects,
such as Greek, and Latin, Coptic, Persian, Turkish, be
traced back to their common source, the Hebrew?</q>
</p>

<p>
It is astonishing what an amount of real learning and
ingenuity was wasted on this question during the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries. It finds, perhaps, but
one parallel in the laborious calculations and constructions
of early astronomers, who had to account for the
movements of the heavenly bodies, always taking it for
granted that the earth must be the fixed centre of our
planetary system. But, although we know now that
the labors of such scholars as Thomassin were, and
could not be otherwise than fruitless, it would be a most
discouraging view to take of the progress of the human
race, were we to look upon the exertions of eminent
men in former ages, though they may have been in a
wrong direction, as mere vanity and vexation of spirit.
We must not forget that the very fact of the failure of
such men contributed powerfully to a general conviction
that there must be something wrong in the problem itself,
till at last a bolder genius inverted the problem and
thereby solved it. When books after books had been
<pb n='134'/><anchor id='Pg134'/>
written to show how Greek and Latin and all other
languages were derived from Hebrew,<note place='foot'>Guichard
went so far as to maintain that as Hebrew was written from
right to left, and Greek from left to right, Greek words might be traced
back to Hebrew by being simply read from right to left.</note> and when not
one single system proved satisfactory, people asked at
last&mdash;<q>Why then <emph>should</emph> all languages be derived from
Hebrew?</q>&mdash;and this very question solved the problem.
It might have been natural for theologians in the fourth
and fifth centuries, many of whom knew neither Hebrew
nor any language except their own, to take it for granted
that Hebrew was the source of all languages, but there
is neither in the Old nor the New Testament a single
word to necessitate this view. Of the language of
Adam we know nothing; but if Hebrew, as we know
it, was one of the languages that sprang from the confusion
of tongues at Babel, it could not well have been
the language of Adam or of the whole earth, <q>when
the whole earth was still of one speech.</q><note place='foot'>Among
the different systems of Rabbinical exegesis, there is one according
to which every letter in Hebrew is reduced to its numerical value,
and the word is explained by another of the same quantity; thus, from the
passage, <q>And all the inhabitants of the earth were of one language.</q>
(Gen. xi. 1), is deduced that they all spoke Hebrew, שכה being changed
for its synonym לשון, and הקרש, (5 + 100 + 4 + 300 = 409) is substituted for
its equivalent אחת (1 + 8 + 400 = 409). <hi rend='italic'>Coheleth</hi>,

Although, therefore, a certain advance was made
towards a classification of languages by the Semitic
scholars of the seventeenth century, yet this partial
advance became in other respects an impediment.
The purely scientific interest in arranging languages
according to their characteristic features was lost sight
of, and erroneous ideas were propagated, the influence
of which has even now not quite subsided.

<p>
The first who really conquered the prejudice that
<pb n='135'/><anchor id='Pg135'/>
Hebrew was the source of all language was Leibniz,
the cotemporary and rival of Newton. <q>There is as
much reason,</q> he said, <q>for supposing Hebrew to have
been the primitive language of mankind, as there is for
adopting the view of Goropius, who published a work
at Antwerp, in 1580, to prove that Dutch was the
language spoken in Paradise.</q><note place='foot'><p>Hermathena

<p>
A curious discussion took place about two hundred years ago in the Metropolitan
Chapter of Pampeluna. The decision, as entered in the minutes
of the chapter, is as follows:&mdash;1. Was Bask the primitive language of
mankind? The learned members confess that, in spite of their strong conviction
on the subject, they dare not give an affirmative answer. 2. Was
Bask the only language spoken by Adam and Eve in Paradise? On this
point the chapter declares that no doubt can exist in their minds, and that
<q>it is impossible to bring forward any serious or rational objection.</q> See

is like calling branches of a tree primitive

be conceived, but they do not agree with the laws of
nature, and with the harmony of the universe, that is
to say with the Divine Wisdom.</q><note place='foot'>Guhrauer's
Life of Leibniz, ii. p. 129.</note>
</p>

<p>
But Leibniz did more than remove this one great
stumbling-block from the threshold of the science of
language. He was the first to apply the principle of
sound inductive reasoning to a subject which before
him had only been treated at random. He pointed
<pb n='136'/><anchor id='Pg136'/>
out the necessity of collecting, first of all, as large a
number of facts as possible.<note place='foot'>Guhrauer, vol.
ii. p. 127. In his <q>Dissertation on the Origin of Nations,</q>
1710, Leibniz says:&mdash;<q>The study of languages must not be conducted
according to any other principles but those of the exact sciences.
Why begin with the unknown instead of the known? It stands to reason
that we ought to begin with studying the modern languages which are
within our reach, in order to compare them with one another, to discover
their differences and affinities, and then to proceed to those which have
preceded them in former ages, in order to show their filiation and their
origin, and then to ascend step by step to the most ancient tongues, the
analysis of which must lead us to the only trustworthy conclusions.</q></note>
He appealed to missionaries, travellers, ambassadors, princes, and emperors, to
help him in a work which he had so much at heart.
The Jesuits in China had to work for him.

the traveller, sent him a most precious present, a translation
of the Lord's Prayer into the jargon of the Hottentots.
<q>My friend,</q> writes Leibniz in thanking him,
<q>remember, I implore you, and remind your Muscovite
friends, to make researches in order to procure
specimens of the Scythian languages, the Samoyedes,
Siberians, Bashkirs, Kalmuks, Tungusians, and others.</q>
Having made the acquaintance of Peter the Great,
Leibniz wrote to him the following letter, dated Vienna,
October the 26th, 1713:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>I have suggested that the numerous languages,
hitherto almost entirely unknown and unstudied, which
are current in the empire of your Majesty and on its
frontiers, should be reduced to writing; also that dictionaries,
or at least small vocabularies, should be collected,
and translations be procured in such languages
of the Ten Commandments, the Lord's Prayer, the
Apostolic Symbolum, and other parts of the Catechism,
<pb n='137'/><anchor id='Pg137'/>
<emph>ut omnis lingua laudet Dominum</emph>. This would increase
the glory of your Majesty, who reigns over so many
nations, and is so anxious to improve them; and it
would, likewise, by means of a comparison of languages,
enable us to discover the origin of those nations
who from Scythia, which is subject to your
Majesty, advanced into other countries. But principally
it would help to plant Christianity among the
nations speaking those dialects, and I have, therefore,
addressed the Most Rev. Metropolitan on the same
subject.</q><note place='foot'>Catherinens der Grossen Verdienste um die Vergleichende

</p>

<p>
Leibniz drew up a list of the most simple and necessary
terms which should be selected for comparison in
various languages. At home, while engaged in historical
researches, he collected whatever could throw light
on the origin of the German language, and he encouraged
others, such as Eccard, to do the same. He
pointed out the importance of dialects, and even of provincial
and local terms, for elucidating the etymological
structure of languages.<note place='foot'>Collectanea Etymologica, ii. 255.

Leibniz never undertook a systematic classification of the whole realm of language,
nor was he successful in classing the dialects with
which he had become acquainted. He distinguished
between a Japhetic and Aramaic class, the former
occupying the north, the latter the south, of the continent
of Asia and Europe. He believed in a common
origin of languages, and in a migration of the human
race from east to west. But he failed to distinguish
<pb n='138'/><anchor id='Pg138'/>
the exact degrees of relationship in which languages
stood to each other, and he mixed up some of the
Turanian dialects, such as Finnish and Tataric, with
the Japhetic family of speech. If Leibniz had found
time to work out all the plans which his fertile and
comprehensive genius conceived, or if he had been
understood and supported by cotemporary scholars, the
science of language, as one of the inductive sciences,
might have been established a century earlier. But a
man like Leibniz, who was equally distinguished as a
scholar, a theologian, a lawyer, an historian, and a mathematician,
could only throw out hints as to how language
ought to be studied. Leibniz was not only the
discoverer of the differential calculus. He was one
of the first to watch the geological stratification of
the earth. He was engaged in constructing a calculating
machine, the idea of which he first conceived
as a boy. He drew up an elaborate plan of an expedition
to Egypt, which he submitted to Louis XIV. in
order to avert his attention from the frontiers of Germany.
The same man was engaged in a long correspondence
with Bossuet to bring about a reconciliation
between Protestants and Romanists, and he endeavored,
in his Theodicée and other works, to defend the
cause of truth and religion against the inroads of the
materialistic philosophy of England and France. It
has been said, indeed, that the discoveries of Leibniz
produced but little effect, and that most of them had
to be made again. This is not the case, however, with
regard to the science of language. The new interest
in languages, which Leibniz had called into life, did
not die again. After it had once been recognized as
a desideratum to bring together a complete <hi rend='italic'>Herbarium</hi>
<pb n='139'/><anchor id='Pg139'/>
of the languages of mankind, missionaries and travellers
felt it their duty to collect lists of words, and draw
up grammars wherever they came in contact with a
new race. The two great works in which, at the beginning
of our century, the results of these researches
were summed up, I mean the Catalogue of Languages
by Hervas, and the Mithridates of Adelung, can both
be traced back directly to the influence of Leibniz.
As to Hervas, he had read Leibniz carefully, and
though he differs from him on some points, he fully
acknowledges his merits in promoting a truly philosophical
study of languages. Of Adelung's Mithridates
and his obligations to Leibniz we shall have to
speak presently.
</p>

<p>
Hervas lived from 1735 to 1809. He was a Spaniard
by birth, and a Jesuit by profession. While working
as a missionary among the Polyglottous tribes of
America, his attention was drawn to a systematic study
of languages. After his return, he lived chiefly at
Rome in the midst of the numerous Jesuit missionaries
who had been recalled from all parts of the world, and
who, by their communications on the dialects of the
tribes among whom they had been laboring, assisted
him greatly in his researches.
</p>

<p>
Most of his works were written in Italian, and were
afterwards translated into Spanish. We cannot enter
into the general scope of his literary labors, which are
of the most comprehensive character. They were intended
to form a kind of Kosmos, for which he chose
the title of <q><hi rend='italic'>Idea del Universo</hi>.</q> What is of interest
to us is that portion which treats of man and language
as part of the universe; and here, again, chiefly his
Catalogue of Languages, in six volumes, published in
Spanish in the year 1800.
</p>

<pb n='140'/><anchor id='Pg140'/>

<p>
If we compare the work of Hervas with a similar
work which excited much attention towards the end
of the last century, and is even now more widely
known than Hervas, I mean Court de Gebelin's
<q>Monde Primitif,</q><note place='foot'>Monde
primitif analysé et comparé avec le monde moderne: Paris,
1773.</note> we shall see at once how far
superior the Spanish Jesuit is to the French philosopher.
Gebelin treats Persian, Armenian, Malay, and
Coptic as dialects of Hebrew; he speaks of Bask as
a dialect of Celtic, and he tries to discover Hebrew,
Greek, English, and French words in the idioms of
America. Hervas, on the contrary, though embracing
in his catalogue five times the number of languages
that were known to Gebelin, is most careful not to
allow himself to be carried away by theories not
warranted by the evidence before him. It is easy
now to point out mistakes and inaccuracies in Hervas,
but I think that those who have blamed him most are
those who ought most to have acknowledged their
obligations to him. To have collected specimens and
notices of more than 300 languages is no small matter.
But Hervas did more. He himself composed grammars
of more than forty languages.<note place='foot'>Catalogo, i. 63.</note> He was the first
to point out that the true affinities of languages must
be determined chiefly by grammatical evidence, not by
mere similarity of words.<note place='foot'><q>Mas se
deben consultar gramaticas para conocer su caracter proprio
por medio de su artificio gramatical.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Catalogo</hi>,
i. 65. The same principle
was expressed by Lord Monboddo, about 1795, in his Ancient Metaphysics,
vol. iv. p. 326. <q>My last observation is, that, as the art of a
language is less arbitrary and more determined by rule than either the
sound or sense of words, it is one of the principal things by which the connection
of languages with one another is to be discovered. And, therefore,
when we find that two languages practise these great arts of language,&mdash;derivation,
composition, and flexion,&mdash;in the same way, we may conclude,
I think, with great certainty, that the one language is the original of the
other, or that they are both dialects of the same language.</q></note>
He proved, by a comparative
<pb n='141'/><anchor id='Pg141'/>
list of declensions and conjugations, that Hebrew,
Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic, and Amharic are
all but dialects of one original language, and constitute
one family of speech, the Semitic.<note place='foot'>Catalogo, ii. 468.</note> He scouted
the idea of deriving all the languages of mankind from
Hebrew. He had perceived clear traces of affinity in
Hungarian, Lapponian, and Finnish, three dialects
now classed as members of the Turanian family.<note place='foot'>Ibid.
i. 49. Witsen, too, in a letter to Leibniz, dated Mai 22, 1698,
alludes to the affinity between the Tataric and Mongolic languages. <q>On
m'a dit que ces deux langues (la langue Moegale et Tartare) sont différentes
à peu près comme l'Allemand l'est du Flamand, et qu'il est de
même des Kalmucs et Moegals.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Collectanea
Etymologica</hi>, ii. p. 363.</note> He
had proved that Bask was not, as was commonly supposed,
a Celtic dialect, but an independent language,
spoken by the earliest inhabitants of Spain, as proved
by the names of the Spanish mountains and rivers.<note place='foot'>Leibniz
held the same opinion (see Hervas, Catalogo, i. 50), though he
considered the Celts in Spain as descendants of the Iberians.</note>
Nay, one of the most brilliant discoveries in the history
of the science of language, the establishment of
the Malay and Polynesian family of speech, extending
from the island of Madagascar east of Africa, over 208
degrees of longitude, to the Easter Islands west of
America,<note place='foot'><p>Catalogo, i. 30. <q>Verá
que la lengua llamada <hi rend='italic'>malaya</hi>, la qual se habla

archipiélago hasta islas, que por su poca distancia de América se creian pobladas
por americanos. La isla de Madagascar se pone á 60 grados de

habla otro dialecto malayo; por lo que la extension de los dialectos malayos
es de 208 grados de longitud.</q></p></note> was made by Hervas long before it was
announced to the world by Humboldt.
</p>

<pb n='142'/><anchor id='Pg142'/>

<p>
Hervas was likewise aware of the great grammatical
similarity between Sanskrit and Greek, but the imperfect
information which he received from his friend, the
Carmelite missionary, Fra Paolino de San Bartolomeo,
the author of the first Sanskrit grammar, published at
Rome in 1790, prevented him from seeing the full
meaning of this grammatical similarity. How near
Hervas was to the discovery of the truth may be seen
from his comparing such words as <emph>theos</emph>, God, in Greek,
with <emph>Deva</emph>, God, in Sanskrit. He identified the Greek
auxiliary verb <emph>eimi</emph>, <emph>eis</emph>, <emph>esti</emph>, I am, thou art, he
is, with the Sanskrit <emph>asmi</emph>, <emph>asi</emph>, <emph>asti</emph>. He even
pointed out that the terminations of the three genders<note place='foot'>Catalogo,
ii. 134.</note> in Greek, <emph>os</emph>, <emph>ē</emph>,
<emph>on</emph>, are the same as the Sanskrit, <emph>as</emph>,
<emph>â</emph>, <emph>am</emph>. But believing,
as he did, that the Greeks derived their philosophy
and mythology from India,<note place='foot'>Ibid. ii. 135.</note> he supposed that
they had likewise borrowed from the Hindus some of
their words, and even the art of distinguishing the
gender of words.
</p>

<p>
The second work which represents the science of
language at the beginning of this century, and which
is, to a still greater extent, the result of the impulse
which Leibniz had given, is the Mithridates of Adelung.<note place='foot'>The
first volume appeared in 1806. He died before the second volume
was published, which was brought out by Vater in 1809. The third and
fourth volumes followed in 1816 and 1817, edited by Vater and the younger
Adelung.</note>
Adelung's work depends partly on Hervas,
<pb n='143'/><anchor id='Pg143'/>
partly on the collections of words which had been made
under the auspices of the Russian government. Now
these collections are clearly due to Leibniz. Although
Peter the Great had no time or taste for philological
studies, the government kept the idea of collecting all
the languages of the Russian empire steadily in view.<note place='foot'>Evidence
of this is to be found in Strahlenberg's work on the <q>North
and East of Europe and Asia,</q> 1730; with tabula polyglotta, &amp;c.; in Messerschmidt's
<q>Travels in Siberia,</q> from 1729-1739; in Bachmeister, <q>Idea
et desideria de colligendis linguarum speciminibus:</q> Petropoli, 1773; in
Güldenstädt's <q>Travels in the Caucasus,</q> &amp;c.</note>
Still greater luck was in store for the science of language.
Having been patronized by Cæsar at Rome, it
found a still more devoted patroness in the great Cesarina
of the North, Catherine the Great (1762-1796).
Even as Grand-duchess Catherine was engrossed with
the idea of a Universal Dictionary, on the plan suggested
by Leibniz. She encouraged the chaplain of
the British Factory at St. Petersburg, the Rev. Daniel
Dumaresq, to undertake the work, and he is said to
have published, at her desire, a <q>Comparative Vocabulary
of Eastern Languages,</q> in quarto; a work,
however, which, if ever published, is now completely
lost. The reputed author died in London in 1805, at
the advanced age of eighty-four. When Catherine
came to the throne, her plans of conquest hardly absorbed
more of her time than her philological studies;
and she once shut herself up nearly a year, devoting
all her time to the compilation of her Comparative
Dictionary. A letter of hers to Zimmermann, dated the
9th of May, 1785, may interest some of my hearers:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>Your letter,</q> she writes, <q>has drawn me from the
solitude in which I had shut myself up for nearly nine
months, and from which I found it hard to stir. You
<pb n='144'/><anchor id='Pg144'/>
will not guess what I have been about. I will tell you,
for such things do not happen every day. I have been
making a list of from two to three hundred radical
words of the Russian language, and I have had them
translated into as many languages and jargons as I
could find. Their number exceeds already the second
hundred. Every day I took one of these words and
wrote it out in all the languages which I could collect.
This has taught me that the Celtic is like the Ostiakian:
that what means sky in one language means
cloud, fog, vault, in others; that the word God in certain
dialects means Good, the Highest, in others, sun
or fire. (Up to here her letter is written in French;
then follows a line of German.) I became tired of
my hobby, after I had read your book on Solitude.
(Then again in French.) But as I should have been
sorry to throw such a mass of paper in the fire;&mdash;besides,
the room, six fathoms in length, which I use
as a boudoir in my hermitage, was pretty well warmed&mdash;I
asked Professor Pallas to come to me, and after
making an honest confession of my sin, we agreed to
publish these collections, and thus make them useful
to those who like to occupy themselves with the forsaken
toys of others. We are only waiting for some
more dialects of Eastern Siberia. Whether the world
at large will or will not see in this work bright ideas
of different kinds, must depend on the disposition of
their minds, and does not concern me in the least.</q>
</p>

<p>
If an empress rides a hobby, there are many ready
to help her. Not only were all Russian ambassadors
instructed to collect materials; not only did German
professors<note place='foot'>The empress wrote to Nicolai at Berlin to
ask him to draw up a catalogue of grammars and dictionaries. The work was sent to her in
manuscript from Berlin, in 1785.</note> supply grammars and dictionaries, but
<pb n='145'/><anchor id='Pg145'/>
Washington himself, in order to please the empress,
sent her list of words to all governors and generals
of the United States, enjoining them to supply the
equivalents from the American dialects. The first
volume of the Imperial Dictionary<note place='foot'><q>Glossarium
comparativum Linguarum totius Orbis:</q> Petersburg,
1787. A second edition, in which the words are arranged alphabetically,
appeared in 1790-91, in 4 vols., edited by Jankiewitsch de Miriewo. It contains
279 (272) languages, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>
171 for Asia, 55 for Europe, 30 for Africa,
and 23 for America. According to Pott, <q>Ungleichheit,</q> p. 230, it contains

This would make 280. It is a very scarce book.</note> appeared in 1787,
containing a list of 285 words translated into fifty-one
European, and 149 Asiatic languages. Though full
credit should be given to the empress for this remarkable
undertaking, it is but fair to remember that it was
the philosopher who, nearly a hundred years before,
sowed the seed that fell into good ground.
</p>

<p>
As collections, the works of Hervas, of the Empress
Catherine, and of Adelung, are highly important,
though, such is the progress made in the classification
of languages during the last fifty years, that few people
would now consult them. Besides, the principle
of classification which is followed in these works can
hardly claim to be called scientific. Languages are arranged
geographically, as the languages of Europe, Asia,
Africa, America, and Polynesia, though, at the same
time, natural affinities are admitted which would unite
dialects spoken at a distance of 208 degrees. Languages
seemed to float about like islands on the ocean
of human speech; they did not shoot together to form
themselves into larger continents. This is a most critical
period in the history of every science, and if it
<pb n='146'/><anchor id='Pg146'/>
had not been for a happy accident, which, like an electric
spark, caused the floating elements to crystallize
into regular forms, it is more than doubtful whether
the long list of languages and dialects, enumerated and
described in the works of Hervas and Adelung, could
long have sustained the interest of the student of languages.
This electric spark was the discovery of Sanskrit.
Sanskrit is the ancient language of the Hindus.
It had ceased to be a spoken language at least 300 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>
At that time the people of India spoke dialects standing
to the ancient Vedic Sanskrit in the relation of
Italian to Latin. We know some of these dialects,
for there were more than one in various parts of India,
from the inscriptions which the famous King Aśoka
had engraved on the rocks of Dhauli, Girnar, and
Kapurdigiri, and which have been deciphered by Prinsep,
Norris, Wilson, and Burnouf. We can watch
the further growth of these local dialects in the so-called
<emph>Pâli</emph>, the sacred language of Buddhism in Ceylon,
and once the popular dialect of the country where
Buddhism took its origin, the modern Behár, the ancient
Magadha.<note place='foot'>The Singhalese call Pali,
Mungata; the Burmese, Magadabâsâ.</note> We meet the same local dialects
again in what are called the Prâkrit idioms, used in
the later plays, in the sacred literature of the Jainas,
and in a few poetical compositions; and we see at last
how, through a mixture with the languages of the
various conquerors of India, the Arabic, Persian,
Mongolic, and Turkish, and through a concomitant
corruption of their grammatical system, they were
changed into the modern Hindí, Hindustání, Mahrattí,
and Bengálí. During all this time, however,
Sanskrit continued as the literary language of the
<pb n='147'/><anchor id='Pg147'/>
Brahmans. Like Latin, it did not die in giving birth
to its numerous offspring; and even at the present day,
an educated Brahman would write with greater fluency
in Sanskrit than in Bengálí. Sanskrit was what Greek
was at Alexandria, what Latin was during the Middle
Ages. It was the classical and at the same time the
sacred language of the Brahmans, and in it were written
their sacred hymns, the Vedas, and the later works,
such as the laws of Manu and the Purâņas.
</p>

<p>
The existence of such a language as the ancient
idiom of the country, and the vehicle of a large literature,
was known at all times; and if there are still any
doubts, like those expressed by Dugald Stewart in his
<q>Conjectures concerning the Origin of the
Sanskrit,</q><note place='foot'>Works, vol. iii. p. 72.</note>
as to its age and authenticity, they will be best removed
by a glance at the history of India, and at the
accounts given by the writers of different nations that
became successively acquainted with the language and
literature of that country.
</p>

<p>
The argument that nearly all the names of persons
and places in India mentioned by Greek and Roman
writers are pure Sanskrit, has been handled so fully
and ably by others, that nothing more remains to be
said.
</p>

<p>
The next nation after the Greeks that became acquainted
with the language and literature of India was
the Chinese. Though Buddhism was not recognized
as a third state-religion before the year 65 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a. d.</hi>, under
the Emperor Ming-ti,<note place='foot'>M. M.'s

One Buddhist missionary is mentioned in the Chinese
<pb n='148'/><anchor id='Pg148'/>
annals in the year 217; and about the year 120 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>,
a Chinese general, after defeating the barbarous tribes
north of the desert of Gobi, brought back as a trophy
a golden statue, the statue of Buddha. The very name
of Buddha, changed in Chinese into Fo-t'o and
Fo,<note place='foot'>Méthode pour déchiffrer et transcrire les noms Sanscrits qui se
rencontrent dans les livres chinois, inventée et démontrée par M. Stanislas
Julien: Paris, 1861, p. 103.</note> is
pure Sanskrit, and so is every word and every thought
of that religion. The language which the Chinese pilgrims
went to India to study, as the key to the sacred
literature of Buddhism, was Sanskrit. They call it
Fan; but Fan, as M. Stanislas Julien has shown, is an
abbreviation of Fan-lan-mo, and this is the only way

Ming-ti, of the dynasty of Han, sending Tsaï-in and other high officials
to India, in order to study there the doctrine of
Buddha. They engaged the services of two learned
Buddhists, Matânga and Tchou-fa-lan, and some of
the most important Buddhist works were translated by
them into Chinese. The intellectual intercourse between
the Indian peninsula and the northern continent
of Asia continued uninterrupted for several centuries.
Missions were sent from China to India to report on
the religious, political, social, and geographical state
of the country; and the chief object of interest, which
attracted public embassies and private pilgrims across
the Himalayan mountains, was the religion of Buddha.
About 300 years after the public recognition of Buddhism
by the Emperor Ming-ti, the great stream of
<pb n='149'/><anchor id='Pg149'/>
Buddhist pilgrims began to flow from China to India.
The first account which we possess of these pilgrimages
refers to the travels of Fa-hian, who visited India
towards the end of the fourth century. His travels
were translated into French by A. Remusat. After
Fa-hian, we have the travels of Hoei-seng and Song-yun,
who were sent to India, in 518, by command of
the empress, with the view of collecting sacred books
and relics. Then followed Hiouen-thsang, whose life
and travels, from 629-645, have been rendered so
popular by the excellent translation of M. Stanislas
Julien. After Hiouen-thsang the principal works of
Chinese pilgrims are the Itineraries of the Fifty-six
Monks, published in 730, and the travels of Khi-nie,
who visited India in 964, at the head of 300 pilgrims.
</p>

<p>
That the language employed for literary purposes in
India during all this time was Sanskrit, we learn, not
only from the numerous names and religious and philosophical
terms mentioned in the travels of the Chinese
pilgrims, but from a short paradigm of declension and
conjugation in Sanskrit which one of them (Hiouen-thsang)
has inserted in his diary.

<p>
Two hundred years more bring us to the reign
of Akbar (1556-1605). A more extraordinary man
never sat on the throne of India. Brought up as a
Muhammedan, he discarded the religion of the Prophet
as superstitious,<note place='foot'>See Vans Kennedy,
<q>Notice respecting the Religion introduced by
Akbar:</q> Transactions of the Literary Society of Bombay: London, 1820,
vol. ii. pp. 242-270.</note> and then devoted himself to a search
after the true religion. He called Brahmans and fire-worshippers
to his court, and ordered them to discuss
in his presence the merits of their religions with the
Muhammedan doctors. When he heard of the Jesuits
at Goa, he invited them to his capital, and he was for
many years looked upon as a secret convert to Christianity.
He was, however, a rationalist and deist, and
never believed anything, as he declared himself, that
he could not understand. The religion which he founded,
the so-called Ilahi religion, was pure Deism mixed
up with the worship of the sun<note place='foot'>Elliot,
Historians of India, p. 249.</note> as the purest and
highest emblem of the Deity. Though Akbar himself
could neither read nor write,<note place='foot'>Müllbauer,
Geschichte der Katholischen Missionen Ostindiens, p. 134.</note> his court was the home
of literary men of all persuasions. Whatever book, in
any language, promised to throw light on the problems
nearest to the emperor's heart, he ordered to be translated
into Persian. The New Testament<note place='foot'>Elliot,
Historians of India, p. 248.</note> was thus
translated at his command; so were the Mahâbhârata,
the Râmâyaņa, the Amarakosha,<note place='foot'>Ibid. pp.
259, 260. The Tarikh-i-Badauni, or Muntakhabu-t-Tawárikh,
written by Mulla Abdu-l-Kádir Maluk, Shah of Badáún, and finished in
1595, is a general history of India from the time of the Ghaznevides to the
40th year of Akbar. The author is a bigoted Muhammedan and judges
Akbar severely, though he was himself under great obligations to him.
He was employed by Akbar to translate from Arabic and Sanskrit into
Persian: he translated the Râmâyaņa, two out of the eighteen sections of
the Mahâbhârata, and abridged a history of Cashmir. These translations
were made under the superintendence of Faizi, the brother of the minister
Abu-l-Fazl. <q>Abulfacel, ministro de Akbar, sevalió del Amarasinha y del
Mahabhárata, que traduxo en persiano el año de

<pb n='152'/><anchor id='Pg152'/>
works of Sanskrit literature. But though the emperor
set the greatest value on the sacred writings of different
nations, he does not seem to have succeeded in extorting
from the Brahmans a translation of the Veda.
A translation of the Atharva-veda<note place='foot'>See
M. M.'s History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 327.</note> was made for him
by Haji Ibrahim Sirhindi; but that Veda never enjoyed
the same authority as the other three Vedas;
and it is doubtful even whether by Atharva-veda is
meant more than the Upanishads, some of which may
have been composed for the special benefit of Akbar.
There is a story which, though evidently of a legendary
character, shows how the study of Sanskrit was
kept up by the Brahmans during the reign of the Mogul
emperors.
</p>

<p>
<q>Neither the authority (it is said) nor promises of
Akbar could prevail upon the Brahmans to disclose
the tenets of their religion: he was therefore obliged to
have recourse to artifice. The stratagem he made use
of was to cause an infant, of the name of <emph>Feizi</emph>, to be
committed to the care of these priests, as a poor orphan
of the sacerdotal line, who alone could be initiated into
the sacred rites of their theology. Feizi, having received
the proper instructions for the part he was to
act, was conveyed privately to Benares, the seat of
knowledge in Hindostan; he was received into the
<pb n='153'/><anchor id='Pg153'/>
house of a learned Brahman, who educated him with
the same care as if he had been his son. After the
youth had spent ten years in study, Akbar was desirous
of recalling him; but he was struck with the charms
of the daughter of his preceptor. The old Brahman
laid no restraint on the growing passion of the two
lovers. He was fond of Feizi, and offered him his
daughter in marriage. The young man, divided between
love and gratitude, resolved to conceal the fraud
no longer, and, falling at the feet of the Brahman,
discovered the imposture, and asked pardon for his offences.
The priest, without reproaching him, seized a
poniard which hung at his girdle, and was going to
plunge it in his heart, if Feizi had not prevented him
by taking hold of his arm. The young man used every
means to pacify him, and declared himself ready to do
anything to expiate his treachery. The Brahman,
bursting into tears, promised to pardon him on condition
that he should swear never to translate the <emph>Vedas</emph>,
or sacred volumes, or disclose to any person whatever
the symbol of the Brahman creed. Feizi readily promised
him: how far he kept his word is not known;
but the sacred books of the Indians have never been
translated.</q><note place='foot'>History of

</p>

<p>
We have thus traced the existence of Sanskrit, as the
language of literature and religion of India, from the
time of Alexander to the reign of Akbar. A hundred
years after Akbar, the eldest son of Shah Jehan, the
unfortunate Dárá, manifested the same interest in religious
speculations which had distinguished his great
<pb n='154'/><anchor id='Pg154'/>
grandsire. He became a student of Sanskrit, and
translated the Upanishads, philosophical treatises appended
to the Vedas, into Persian. This was in the
year 1657, a year before he was put to death by
his younger brother, the bigoted Aurengzebe. This
prince's translation was translated into French by Anquetil
Duperron, in the year 1795, the fourth year of
the French Republic; and was for a long time the
principal source from which European scholars derived
their knowledge of the sacred literature of the
Brahmans.
</p>

<p>
At the time at which we have now arrived, the
reign of Aurengzebe (1658-1707), the cotemporary
and rival of Louis XIV., the existence of Sanskrit and
Sanskrit literature was known, if not in Europe generally,
at least to Europeans in India, particularly to
missionaries. Who was the first European, that knew
of Sanskrit, or that acquired a knowledge of Sanskrit,
is difficult to say. When Vasco de Gama landed at
Calicut, on the 9th of May, 1498, Padre Pedro began
at once to preach to the natives, and had suffered a
martyr's death before the discoverer of India returned
to Lisbon. Every new ship that reached India brought
new missionaries; but for a long time we look in vain
in their letters and reports for any mention of Sanskrit
or Sanskrit literature. Francis, now St. Francis Xavier,
was the first to organize the great work of preaching
the Gospel in India (1542); and such were his zeal
and devotion, such his success in winning the hearts of
high and low, that his friends ascribed to him, among
other miraculous gifts, the gift of tongues<note place='foot'>Müllbauer,
p. 67.</note>&mdash;a gift
never claimed by St. Francis himself. It is not, however,
<pb n='155'/><anchor id='Pg155'/>
till the year 1559 that we first hear of the missionaries
at Goa studying, with the help of a converted
Brahman,<note place='foot'>Ibid. p. 80. These Brahmans, according to Robert de Nobili,
were of a lower class, not initiated in the sacred literature. They were ignorant,
he says, <q>of the books Smarta, Apostamba, and
Sutra.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Müllbauer</hi>, p.
188. Robert himself quotes from the Âpastamba-Sûtra, in his defence,
ibid. p. 192. He also quotes Scanda Purâna, p. 193; Kadambari, p. 193.</note>
the theological and philosophical literature
of the country, and challenging the Brahmans to public
disputations.
</p>

<p>
The first certain instance of a European missionary
having mastered the difficulties of the Sanskrit language,
belongs to a still later period,&mdash;to what may
be called the period of Roberto de Nobili, as distinguished
from the first period, which is under the presiding
spirit of Francis Xavier. Roberto de Nobili
went to India in 1606. He was himself a man of
high family, of a refined and cultivated mind, and he
perceived the more quickly the difficulties which kept
the higher castes, and particularly the Brahmans, from
joining the Christian communities formed at Madura
and other places. These communities consisted chiefly
of men of low rank, of no education, and no refinement.
He conceived the bold plan of presenting himself as a
Brahman, and thus obtaining access to the high and
noble, the wise and learned, in the land. He shut himself
up for years, acquiring in secret a knowledge, not
only of Tamil and Telugu, but of Sanskrit. When, after
a patient study of the language and literature of the
Brahmans, he felt himself strong enough to grapple with
his antagonists, he showed himself in public, dressed in
the proper garb of the Brahmans, wearing their cord
and their frontal mark, observing their diet, and submitting
even to the complicated rules of caste. He
<pb n='156'/><anchor id='Pg156'/>
was successful, in spite of the persecutions both of the
Brahmans, who were afraid of him, and of his own
fellow-laborers, who could not understand his policy.
His life in India, where he died as an old blind man,
is full of interest to the missionary. I can only speak
of him here as the first European Sanskrit scholar. A
man who could quote from Manu, from the Purâņas,
and even from works such as the Âpastamba-sûtras,
which are known even at present to only those few
Sanskrit scholars who can read Sanskrit MSS., must
have been far advanced in a knowledge of the sacred
language and literature of the Brahmans; and the
very idea that he came, as he said, to preach a new
or a fourth Veda,<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>The Ezour-Veda</hi>
is not the work of Robert de Nobili. It was probably
written by one of his converts. It is in Sanskrit verse, in the style of the
Pûraņas, and contains a wild mixture of Hindu and Christian doctrine.
The French translation was sent to Voltaire and printed by him in 1778,
<q>L'Ezour Vedam traduit du Sanscritam par un Brame.</q> Voltaire expressed
his belief that the original was four centuries older than Alexander,
and that it was the most precious gift for which the West had been
ever indebted to the East. Mr. Ellis discovered the Sanskrit original at
Pondichery. (Asiatic Researches, vol. xiv.) There is no evidence for
ascribing the work to Robert, and it is not mentioned in the list of his
works. (Bertrand, la Mission du Maduré, Paris, 1847-50, t. iii. p. 116;
Müllbauer, p. 205, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi>.)</note> which had been lost, shows how
well he knew the strong and weak points of the theological
system which he came to conquer. It is surprising
that the reports which he sent to Rome, in
order to defend himself against the charge of idolatry,
and in which he drew a faithful picture of the religion,
the customs, and literature of the Brahmans, should
not have attracted the attention of scholars. The
<q>Accommodation Question,</q> as it was called, occupied
cardinals and popes for many years; but not one
of them seems to have perceived the extraordinary
<pb n='157'/><anchor id='Pg157'/>
interest attaching to the existence of an ancient civilization
so perfect and so firmly rooted as to require
accommodation even from the missionaries of Rome.
At a time when the discovery of one Greek MS. would
have been hailed by all the scholars of Europe, the
discovery of a complete literature was allowed to pass
unnoticed. The day of Sanskrit had not yet come.
</p>

<p>
The first missionaries who succeeded in rousing the
attention of European scholars to the extraordinary
discovery that had been made were the French Jesuit
missionaries, whom Louis XIV. had sent out to India
after the treaty of Ryswick, in 1697.<note place='foot'>In 1677
a Mr. Marshall is said to have been a proficient in Sanskrit.
Elliot's Historians of India, p. 265.</note> Father Pons
drew up a comprehensive account of the literary treasures
of the Brahmans; and his report, dated Karikal
(dans le Maduré), November 23, 1740, and addressed
to Father Duhalde, was published in the <q>Lettres
édifiantes.</q><note place='foot'>See an excellent
account of this letter in an article of M. Biot in the
<q>Journal des Savants,</q> 1861.</note>
Father Pons gives in it a most interesting
and, in general, a very accurate description of the
various branches of Sanskrit literature,&mdash;of the four
Vedas, the grammatical treatises, the six systems of
philosophy, and the astronomy of the Hindus. He
anticipated, on several points, the researches of Sir
William Jones.
</p>

<p>
But, although the letter of Father Pons excited a
deep interest, that interest remained necessarily barren,
as long as there were no grammars, dictionaries, and
Sanskrit texts to enable scholars in Europe to study
Sanskrit in the same spirit in which they studied Greek
and Latin. The first who endeavored to supply this
want was a Carmelite friar, a German of the name
<pb n='158'/><anchor id='Pg158'/>
of Johann Philip Wesdin, better known as Paulinus
a Santo Bartholomeo. He was in India from 1776 to
1789; and he published the first grammar of Sanskrit
at Rome, in 1790. Although this grammar has been
severely criticised, and is now hardly ever consulted, it
is but fair to bear in mind that the first grammar of
any language is a work of infinitely greater difficulty
than any later grammar.<note place='foot'>Sidharubam

</p>

<p>
We have thus seen how the existence of the Sanskrit
language and literature was known ever since India
had first been discovered by Alexander and his companions.
But what was not known was, that this language,
as it was spoken at the time of Alexander, and
at the time of Solomon, and for centuries before his
time, was intimately related to Greek and Latin, in
fact, stood to them in the same relation as French
to Italian and Spanish. The history of what may be
called European Sanskrit philology dates from the
foundation of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, in 1784.<note place='foot'>The
earliest publications were the <q>Bhagavadgîta,</q> translated by Wilkins,
1785; the <q>Hitopadeśa,</q> translated by Wilkins, 1787; and the <q>Sakuntalâ,</q>
translated by W. Jones, 1789. Original grammars, without
mentioning mere compilations, were published by Colebrooke, 1805; by
Carey, 1806; by Wilkins, 1808; by Forster, 1810; by Yates, 1820; by Wilson,
1841. In Germany, Bopp published his grammars in 1827, 1832, 1834;
Benfey, in 1852 and 1855.</note>
It was through the labors of Sir William Jones, Carey,
Wilkins, Forster, Colebrooke, and other members of
that illustrious Society, that the language and literature
of the Brahmans became first accessible to European
<pb n='159'/><anchor id='Pg159'/>
scholars; and it would be difficult to say which of
the two, the language or the literature, excited the
deepest and most lasting interest. It was impossible to
look, even in the most cursory manner, at the declensions
and conjugations, without being struck by the
extraordinary similarity, or, in some cases, by the absolute
identity of the grammatical forms in Sanskrit,
Greek, and Latin. As early as 1778, Halhed remarked,
in the preface to his Grammar of Bengalí,<note place='foot'>Halhed
had published in 1776 the <q>Code of Gentoo Laws,</q> a digest of
the most important Sanskrit law-books made by eleven Brahmans, by the
order of Warren Hastings.</note>
<q>I have been astonished to find this similitude of Sanskrit
words with those of Persian and Arabic, and even
of Latin and Greek; and these not in technical and
metaphorical terms, which the mutuation of refined arts
and improved manners might have occasionally introduced;
but in the main groundwork of language, in
monosyllables, in the names of numbers, and the appellations
of such things as could be first discriminated
on the immediate dawn of civilization.</q> Sir William
Jones (died 1794), after the first glance at Sanskrit,
declared that whatever its antiquity, it was a language
of most wonderful structure, more perfect than the
Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely
refined than either, yet bearing to both of them
a strong affinity. <q>No philologer,</q> he writes, <q>could
examine the Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, without believing
them to have sprung from some common source,
which, perhaps, no longer exists. There is a similar reason,
though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both
the Gothic and Celtic had the same origin with the Sanskrit.
The old Persian may be added to the same family.</q>
</p>

<pb n='160'/><anchor id='Pg160'/>

<p>
But how was that affinity to be explained? People
were completely taken by surprise. Theologians shook
their heads; classical scholars looked sceptical; philosophers
indulged in the wildest conjectures in order to
escape from the only possible conclusion which could
be drawn from the facts placed before them, but which
threatened to upset their little systems of the history of
the world. Lord Monboddo had just finished his great
work<note place='foot'><q>On the Origin and Progress
of Language,</q> second edition, Edinburgh,
1774. 6 vols.</note> in which he derives all mankind from a couple
of apes, and all the dialects of the world from a language
originally framed by some Egyptian gods,<note place='foot'><q>I
have supposed that language could not be invented without supernatural
assistance, and, accordingly, I have maintained that it was the invention
of the Dæmon kings of Egypt, who, being more than men, first
taught themselves to articulate, and then taught others. But, even among
them, I am persuaded there was a progress in the art, and that such a language
as the Shanskrit was not at once invented.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Monboddo, Antient
Metaphysics</hi>, vol. iv. p. 357.</note> when
the discovery of Sanskrit came on him like a thunder-bolt.
It must be said, however, to his credit, that he
at once perceived the immense importance of the discovery.
He could not be expected to sacrifice his primæval
monkeys or his Egyptian idols; but, with that
reservation, the conclusions which he drew from the
new evidence placed before him by his friend Mr. Wilkins,
the author of one of our first Sanskrit grammars,
are highly creditable to the acuteness of the Scotch judge.
<q>There is a language,</q> he writes<note place='foot'>Origin
and Progress of Language, vol. vi. p. 97.</note> (in 1792), <q>still
existing, and preserved among the Bramins of India,
which is a richer and in every respect a finer language
than even the Greek of Homer. All the other languages
of India have a great resemblance to this language,
<pb n='161'/><anchor id='Pg161'/>
which is called the Shanscrit. But those languages
are dialects of it, and formed from it, not the
Shanscrit from them. Of this, and other particulars
concerning this language, I have got such certain information
from India, that if I live to finish my history
of man, which I have begun in my third volume of
<q>Antient Metaphysics,</q> I shall be able clearly to prove
that the Greek is derived from the Shanscrit, which
was the antient language of Egypt, and was carried by
the Egyptians into India, with their other arts, and into
Greece by the colonies which they settled there.</q>
</p>

<p>
A few years later (1795) he had arrived at more
definite views on the relation of Sanskrit to Greek;
and he writes,<note place='foot'>Antient Metaphysics,
vol. iv. p. 322.</note> <q>Mr. Wilkins has proved to my conviction
such a resemblance betwixt the Greek and the
Shanscrit, that the one must be a dialect of the other,
or both of some original language. Now the Greek
is certainly not a dialect of the Shanscrit, any more
than the Shanscrit is of the Greek. They must,
therefore, be both dialects of the same language; and
that language could be no other than the language
of Egypt, brought into India by Osiris, of which, undoubtedly,
the Greek was a dialect, as I think I have
proved.</q>
</p>

<p>
Into these theories of Lord Monboddo's on Egypt
and Osiris, we need not inquire at present. But it
may be of interest to give one other extract, in
order to show how well, apart from his men with,
and his monkeys without, tails, Lord Monboddo could
sift and handle the evidence that was placed before
him:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>To apply these observations to the similarities which
<pb n='162'/><anchor id='Pg162'/>
Mr. Wilkins has discovered betwixt the Shanscrit and
the Greek;&mdash;I will begin with these words, which must
have been original words in all languages, as the things
denoted by them must have been known in the first
ages of civility, and have got names; so that it is impossible
that one language could have borrowed them
from another, unless it was a derivative or dialect of
that language. Of this kind are the names of numbers,
of the members of the human body, and of relations,
such as that of father, mother, and brother. And first,
as to numbers, the use of which must have been coeval
with civil society. The words in the Shanscrit for the
numbers from one to ten are, <emph>ek</emph>, <emph>dwee</emph>,
<emph>tree</emph>, <emph>chatoor</emph>,
<emph>panch</emph>, <emph>shat</emph>, <emph>sapt</emph>,
<emph>aght</emph>, <emph>nava</emph>, <emph>das</emph>, which certainly have
an affinity to the Greek or Latin names for those numbers.
Then they proceed towards twenty, saying ten
and one, ten and two, and so forth, till they come to
twenty; for their arithmetic is decimal as well as ours.
Twenty they express by the word <emph>veensatee</emph>. Then
they go on till they come to thirty, which they express
by the word <emph>treensat</emph>, of which the word expressing
three is part of the composition, as well as it is of the
Greek and Latin names for those numbers. And in
like manner they go on expressing forty, fifty, &amp;c., by
a like composition with the words expressing simple
numerals, namely, four, five, &amp;c., till they come to the
number one hundred, which they express by <emph>sat</emph>, a
word different from either the Greek or Latin name for
that number. But, in this numeration, there is a very
remarkable conformity betwixt the word in Shanscrit
expressing twenty or twice ten, and the words in Greek
and Latin expressing the same number; for in none of
the three languages has the word any relation to the
<pb n='163'/><anchor id='Pg163'/>
number two, which, by multiplying ten, makes twenty;
such as the words expressing the numbers thirty, forty,
&amp;c., have to the words expressing three or four; for in
Greek the word is <emph>eikosi</emph>, which expresses no relation
to the number two; nor does the Latin <emph>viginti</emph>, but
which appears to have more resemblance to the Shanscrit
word <emph>veensatee</emph>. And thus it appears that in the
anomalies of the two languages of Greek and Latin,
there appears to be some conformity with the Shanscrit.</q>

Lord Monboddo compares the Sanskrit <emph>pada</emph> with
the Greek <emph>pous</emph>, <emph>podos</emph>; the Sanskrit <emph>nâsa</emph> with the
Latin <emph>nasus</emph>; the Sanskrit <emph>deva</emph>, god, with the Greek
<emph>Theos</emph> and Latin <emph>deus</emph>; the Sanskrit <emph>ap</emph>, water, with
the Latin <emph>aqua</emph>; the Sanskrit <emph>vidhavâ</emph> with the Latin
<emph>vidua</emph>, widow. Sanskrit words such as <emph>gonia</emph>, for
angle, <emph>kentra</emph>, for centre, <emph>hora</emph>, for hour, he points out
as clearly of Greek origin, and imported into Sanskrit.
He then proceeds to show the grammatical
coincidences between Sanskrit and the classical languages.
He dwells on compounds such as <emph>tripada</emph>,
from <emph>tri</emph>, three, and <emph>pada</emph>, foot&mdash;a tripod; he remarks
on the extraordinary fact that Sanskrit, like Greek,
changes a positive into a negative adjective by the addition
of the <emph>a</emph> privative; and he then produces what
he seems to consider as the most valuable present that
Mr. Wilkins could have given him, namely, the Sanskrit
forms, <emph>asmi</emph>, I am; <emph>asi</emph>, thou art; <emph>asti</emph>, he is;
<emph>santi</emph>, they are; forms clearly of the same origin as
the corresponding forms, <emph>esmi</emph>, <emph>eis</emph>, <emph>esti</emph>, in
Greek, and <emph>sunt</emph> in Latin.

<p>
Another Scotch philosopher, Dugald Stewart, was
much less inclined to yield such ready submission.
<pb n='164'/><anchor id='Pg164'/>
No doubt it must have required a considerable effort
for a man brought up in the belief that Greek and
Latin were either aboriginal languages, or modifications
of Hebrew, to bring himself to acquiesce in the
revolutionary doctrine that the classical languages were
intimately related to a jargon of mere savages; for
such all the subjects of the Great Mogul were then
supposed to be. However, if the facts about Sanskrit
were true, Dugald Stewart was too wise not to see
that the conclusions drawn from them were inevitable.
He therefore denied the reality of such a language
as Sanskrit altogether, and wrote his famous essay to
prove that Sanskrit had been put together, after the
model of Greek and Latin, by those arch-forgers and
liars the Brahmans, and that the whole of Sanskrit
literature was an imposition. I mention this fact, because
it shows, better than anything else, how violent
a shock was given by the discovery of Sanskrit to prejudices
most deeply ingrained in the mind of every
educated man. The most absurd arguments found
favor for a time, if they could only furnish a loophole
by which to escape from the unpleasant conclusion that
Greek and Latin were of the same kith and kin as the
language of the black inhabitants of India. The first
who dared boldly to face both the facts and the conclusions
of Sanskrit scholarship was the German poet,
Frederick Schlegel. He had been in England during
the peace of Amiens (1801-1802), and had learned
a smattering of Sanskrit from Mr. Alexander Hamilton.
After carrying on his studies for some time at
Paris, he published, in 1808, his work, <q>On the
Language and Wisdom of the Indians.</q> This work
became the foundation of the science of language.
<pb n='165'/><anchor id='Pg165'/>
Though published only two years after the first volume
of Adelung's <q>Mithridates,</q> it is separated from
that work by the same distance which separates the
Copernican from the Ptolemæan system. Schlegel
was not a great scholar. Many of his statements
have proved erroneous; and nothing would be easier
than to dissect his essay and hold it up to ridicule.
But Schlegel was a man of genius; and when a new
science is to be created, the imagination of the poet is
wanted, even more than the accuracy of the scholar.
It surely required somewhat of poetic vision to embrace
with <emph>one</emph> glance the languages of India, Persia,
Greece, Italy, and Germany, and to rivet them together
by the simple name of Indo-Germanic. This
was Schlegel's work; and in the history of the intellect,
it has truly been called <q>the discovery of a new
world.</q>
</p>

<p>
We shall see, in our next lecture, how Schlegel's
idea was taken up in Germany, and how it led almost
immediately to a genealogical classification of the principal
languages of mankind.

<head>Lecture V. Genealogical Classification Of Languages.</head>

<p>
We traced, in our last Lecture, the history of the
various attempts at a classification of languages to the
year 1808, the year in which Frederick Schlegel published
his little work on <q>The Language and Wisdom
of the Indians.</q> This work was like the wand of a
magician. It pointed out the place where a mine
should be opened; and it was not long before some
of the most distinguished scholars of the day began to
sink their shafts, and raise the ore. For a time, everybody
who wished to learn Sanskrit had to come to
England. Bopp, Schlegel, Lassen, Rosen, Burnouf,
all spent some time in this country, copying manuscripts
at the East-India House, and receiving assistance
from Wilkins, Colebrooke, Wilson, and other distinguished
members of the old Indian Civil Service.
The first minute and scholar-like comparison of the
grammar of Sanskrit with that of Greek and Latin,
Persian, and German, was made by Francis Bopp, in
1816.<note place='foot'>Conjugationssystem: Frankfurt,
1816.</note> Other essays of his followed; and in 1833
appeared the first volume of his <q>Comparative Grammar
of Sanskrit, Zend, Greek, Latin, Lithuanian,
Slavonic, Gothic, and German.</q> This work was not
finished till nearly twenty years later, in
1852;<note place='foot'>New edition in 1856, much improved.</note> but it
<pb n='167'/><anchor id='Pg167'/>
will form forever the safe and solid foundation of comparative
philology. August Wilhelm von Schlegel,
the brother of Frederick Schlegel, used the influence
which he had acquired as a German poet, to popularize
the study of Sanskrit in Germany. His <q>Indische
Bibliothek</q> was published from 1819 to 1830, and
though chiefly intended for Sanskrit literature, it likewise
contained several articles on Comparative Philology.
This new science soon found a still more
powerful patron in William von Humboldt, the worthy
brother of Alexander von Humboldt, and at that time
one of the leading statesmen in Prussia. His essays,
chiefly on the philosophy of language, attracted general
attention during his lifetime; and he left a lasting
monument of his studies in his great work on the
Kawi language, which was published after his death,
in 1836. Another scholar who must be reckoned
among the founders of Comparative Philology is Professor
Pott, whose <q>Etymological Researches</q> appeared
first in 1833 and 1836.<note place='foot'>Second
edition, 1859 and 1861. Pott's work on the Language of the
Gipsies, 1846; his work on Proper Names, 1856.</note> More special in its
purpose, but based on the same general principles, was
Grimm's <q>Teutonic Grammar,</q> a work which has
truly been called colossal. Its publication occupied
nearly twenty years, from 1819 to 1837. We ought,
likewise, to mention here the name of an eminent Dane,
Erasmus Rask, who devoted himself to the study of the
northern languages of Europe. He started, in 1816, for
Persia and India, and was the first to acquire a knowledge
of Zend, the language of the Zend-Avesta; but he
died before he had time to publish all the results of his
learned researches. He had proved, however, that the
<pb n='168'/><anchor id='Pg168'/>
sacred language of the Parsis was closely connected
with the sacred language of the Brahmans, and that,
like Sanskrit, it had preserved some of the earliest formations
of Indo-European speech. These researches
into the ancient Persian language were taken up again
by one of the greatest scholars that France ever produced,
by Eugène Burnouf. Though the works of
Zoroaster had been translated before by Anquetil Duperron,
his was only a translation of a modern Persian
translation of the original. It was Burnouf who, by
means of his knowledge of Sanskrit and Comparative
Grammar, deciphered for the first time the very words
of the founder of the ancient religion of light. He
was, likewise, the first to apply the same key with
real success to the cuneiform inscriptions of Darius
and Xerxes; and his premature death will long be
mourned, not only by those who, like myself, had the
privilege of knowing him personally and attending his
lectures, but by all who have the interest of oriental
literature and of real oriental scholarship at heart.
</p>

<p>
I cannot give here a list of all the scholars who
followed in the track of Bopp, Schlegel, Humboldt,
Grimm, and Burnouf. How the science of language
has flourished and abounded may best be seen in the
library of any comparative philologist. There has been
for the last ten years a special journal of Comparative
Philology in Germany. The Philological Society in
London publishes every year a valuable volume of its
transactions; and in almost every continental university
there is a professor of Sanskrit who lectures
likewise on Comparative Grammar and the science
of language.
</p>

<p>
But why, it may naturally be asked, why should the
<pb n='169'/><anchor id='Pg169'/>
discovery of Sanskrit have wrought so complete a
change in the classificatory study of languages? If
Sanskrit had been the primitive language of mankind,
or at least the parent of Greek, Latin, and German,
we might understand that it should have led to quite a
new classification of these tongues. But Sanskrit does
not stand to Greek, Latin, the Teutonic, Celtic, and
Slavonic languages in the relation of Latin to French,
Italian, and Spanish. Sanskrit, as we saw before,
could not be called their parent, but only their elder
sister. It occupies with regard to the classical languages
a position analogous to that which Provençal
occupies with regard to the modern Romance dialects.
This is perfectly true; but it was exactly this necessity
of determining distinctly and accurately the mutual
relation of Sanskrit and the other members of the same
family of speech, which led to such important results,
and particularly to the establishment of the laws of phonetic
change as the only safe means for measuring the
various degrees of relationship of cognate dialects, and
thus restoring the genealogical tree of human speech.
When Sanskrit had once assumed its right position,
when people had once become familiarized with the
idea that there must have existed a language more
primitive than Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit, and forming
the common background of these three, as well as
of the Teutonic, Celtic, and Slavonic branches of
speech, all languages seemed to fall by themselves into
their right position. The key of the puzzle was found,
and all the rest was merely a work of patience. The
same arguments by which Sanskrit and Greek had
been proved to hold co-ordinate rank were perceived to
apply with equal strength to Latin and Greek; and
<pb n='170'/><anchor id='Pg170'/>
after Latin had once been shown to be more primitive
on many points than Greek, it was easy to see that the
Teutonic, the Celtic, and the Slavonic languages also,
contained each a number of formations which it was
impossible to derive from Sanskrit, Greek, or Latin.
It was perceived that all had to be treated as co-ordinate
members of one and the same class.
</p>

<p>
The first great step in advance, therefore, which was
made in the classification of languages, chiefly through
the discovery of Sanskrit, was this, that scholars were
no longer satisfied with the idea of a general relationship,
but began to inquire for the different degrees of
relationship in which each member of a class stood to
another. Instead of mere <emph>classes</emph>, we hear now for the
first time of well regulated <emph>families</emph> of language.
</p>

<p>
A second step in advance followed naturally from
the first. Whereas, for establishing in a general way
the common origin of certain languages, a comparison
of numerals, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, and the
most essential nouns and verbs, had been sufficient, it
was soon found that a more accurate standard was
required for measuring the more minute degrees of
relationship. Such a standard was supplied by Comparative
Grammar; that is to say, by an intercomparison
of the grammatical forms of languages supposed to
be related to each other; such intercomparison being
carried out according to certain laws which regulate
the phonetic changes of letters.
</p>

<p>
A glance at the modern history of language will
make this clearer. There could never be any doubt
that the so-called Romance languages, Italian, Wallachian,
Provençal, French, Spanish, and Portuguese,
were closely related to each other. Everybody could
<pb n='171'/><anchor id='Pg171'/>
see that they were all derived from Latin. But
one of the most distinguished French scholars, Raynouard,
who has done more for the history of the Romance
languages and literature than any one else,
maintained that Provençal only was the daughter of
Latin; whereas French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese
were the daughters of Provençal. He maintained
that Latin passed, from the seventh to the ninth
century, through an intermediate stage, which he called
Langue Romane, and which he endeavored to prove
was the same as the Provençal of Southern France,
the language of the Troubadours. According to him,
it was only after Latin had passed through this uniform
metamorphosis, represented by the Langue Romane or
Provençal, that it became broken up into the various
Romance dialects of Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal.
This theory, which was vigorously attacked by
August Wilhelm von Schlegel, and afterwards minutely
criticised by Sir Cornewall Lewis, can only be refuted
by a comparison of the Provençal grammar with that
of the other Romance dialects. And here, if you take
the auxiliary verb <emph>to be</emph>, and compare its forms in Provençal
and French, you will see at once that, on several
points, French has preserved the original Latin
forms in a more primitive state than Provençal, and
that, therefore, it is impossible to classify French as the
daughter of Provençal, and as the granddaughter of
Latin. We have in Provençal:&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><emph>sem</emph>, corresponding to the French <emph>nous sommes</emph>,</l>
<l><emph>etz</emph>, corresponding to the French <emph>vous êtes</emph>,</l>
<l><emph>son</emph>, corresponding to the French <emph>ils sont</emph>,</l>
</lg>

<p>
and it would be a grammatical miracle if crippled
forms, such as <emph>sem</emph>, <emph>etz</emph>, and <emph>son</emph>, had been changed
<pb n='172'/><anchor id='Pg172'/>
back again into the more healthy, more primitive,
more Latin, <emph>sommes</emph>, <emph>êtes</emph>, <emph>sont</emph>;
<emph>sumus</emph>, <emph>estis</emph>, <emph>sunt</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Let us apply the same test to Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin; and we shall see how their mutual genealogical
position is equally determined by a comparison of
their grammatical forms. It is as impossible to derive
Latin from Greek, or Greek from Sanskrit, as it is to
treat French as a modification of Provençal. Keeping
to the auxiliary verb <emph>to be</emph>, we find that <emph>I am</emph>
is in
</p>

<table rend="latexcolumns: 'p{2cm} p{2cm} p{2cm}'; tblcolumns: 'lw(15) lw(15) lw(15)'">
<row><cell>Sanskrit</cell><cell>Greek</cell><cell>Lithuanian</cell></row>
<row><cell><emph>asmi</emph></cell><cell><emph>esmi</emph></cell>
     <cell><emph>esmi</emph>.</cell></row>
</table>

<p>
The root is <emph>as</emph>, the termination <emph>mi</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Now, the termination of the second person is <emph>si</emph>,
which, together with <emph>as</emph>, or <emph>es</emph>, would make,
</p>

<table rend="latexcolumns: 'p{2cm} p{2cm} p{2cm}'; tblcolumns: 'lw(15) lw(15) lw(15)'">
<row><cell><emph>as-si</emph></cell><cell><emph>es-si</emph></cell>
     <cell><emph>es-si</emph>.</cell></row>
</table>

<p>
But here Sanskrit, as far back as its history can be
traced, has reduced <emph>assi</emph> to <emph>asi</emph>; and it would be impossible
to suppose that the perfect, or, as they are
sometimes called, organic, forms in Greek and Lithuanian,
<emph>es-si</emph>, could first have passed through the mutilated
state of the Sanskrit <emph>asi</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The third person is the same in Sanskrit, Greek,
and Lithuanian, <emph>as-ti</emph> or <emph>es-ti</emph>; and, with the loss of
the final <emph>i</emph>, we recognize the Latin
<emph>est</emph>, Gothic <emph>ist</emph>, and
Russian <emph>est'</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The same auxiliary verb can be made to furnish
sufficient proof that Latin never could have passed
through the Greek, or what used to be called the
Pelasgic stage, but that both are independent modifications
of the same original language. In the singular,
Latin is less primitive than Greek; for <emph>sum</emph>
stands for <emph>es-um</emph>, <emph>es</emph> for
<emph>es-is</emph>, <emph>est</emph> for <emph>es-ti</emph>. In the first
<pb n='173'/><anchor id='Pg173'/>
person plural, too, <emph>sumus</emph> stands for <emph>es-umus</emph>, the Greek
<emph>es-mes</emph>, the Sanskrit <emph>'smas</emph>.
The second person <emph>es-tis</emph>,
is equal to Greek <emph>es-te</emph>, and more primitive than Sanskrit
<emph>stha</emph>. But in the third person plural Latin is
more primitive than Greek. The regular form would
be <emph>as-anti</emph>; this, in Sanskrit, is changed into <emph>santi</emph>. In
Greek, the initial <emph>s</emph> is dropped, and the Æolic <emph>enti</emph>, is
finally reduced to <emph>eisi</emph>. The Latin, on the contrary,
has kept the radical <emph>s</emph>, and it would be perfectly
impossible to derive the Latin <emph>sunt</emph> from the Greek
<emph>eisi</emph>.
</p>

<p>
I need hardly say that the modern English, <emph>I am</emph>,
<emph>thou art</emph>, <emph>he is</emph>, are only secondary modifications of the
same primitive verb. We find in Gothic&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><emph>im</emph> for <emph>ism</emph></l>
<l><emph>is</emph> for <emph>iss</emph></l>
<l><emph>ist</emph>.</l>
</lg>

<p>
The Anglo-Saxon changes the <emph>s</emph> into <emph>r</emph>, thus giving&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l><emph>eom</emph> for <emph>eorm</emph>,  plural  <emph>sind</emph> for <emph>isind</emph>.</l>
<l><emph>eart</emph> for <emph>ears</emph>, plural <emph>sind</emph></l>
<l><emph>is</emph> for <emph>ist</emph>, plural <emph>sind</emph></l>
</lg>

<p>
By applying this test to all languages, the founders
of comparative philology soon reduced the principal
dialects of Europe and Asia to certain families, and
they were able in each family to distinguish different
branches, each consisting again of numerous dialects,
both ancient and modern.
</p>

<p>
There are many languages, however, which as yet
have not been reduced to families, and though there
is no reason to doubt that some of them will hereafter
be comprehended in a system of genealogical
classification, it is right to guard from the beginning
<pb n='174'/><anchor id='Pg174'/>
against the common, but altogether gratuitous supposition,
that the principle of genealogical classification
must be applicable to all. Genealogical classification
is no doubt the most perfect of all classifications, but
there are but few branches of physical science in
which it can be carried out, except very partially.
In the science of language, genealogical classification
must rest chiefly on the formal or grammatical elements,
which, after they have been affected by phonetic
change, can be kept up only by a continuous
tradition. We know that French, Italian, Spanish,
and Portuguese must be derived from a common
source, because they share grammatical forms in common,
which none of these dialects could have supplied
from their own resources, and which have no meaning,
or, so to say, no life, in any one of them. The termination
of the imperfect <emph>ba</emph> in Spanish, <emph>va</emph> in Italian, by
which <emph>canto</emph>, I sing, is changed into
<emph>cantaba</emph> and <emph>cantava</emph>,
has no separate existence, and no independent
meaning in either of these modern dialects. It could
not have been formed with the materials supplied by
Spanish and Italian. It must have been handed
down from an earlier generation in which this <emph>ba</emph>
had a meaning. We trace it back to Latin <emph>bam</emph>, in
<emph>cantabam</emph>, and here it can be proved that <emph>bam</emph> was originally
an independent auxiliary verb, the same which
exists in Sanskrit <emph>bhavâmi</emph>, and in the Anglo-Saxon
<emph>beom</emph>, I am. Genealogical classification, therefore,
applies properly only to decaying languages, to languages
in which grammatical growth has been arrested,
through the influence of literary cultivation; in
which little new is added, everything old is retained
as long as possible, and where what we call growth
<pb n='175'/><anchor id='Pg175'/>
or history is nothing but the progress of phonetic corruption.
But before languages decay, they have passed
through a period of growth; and it seems to have been
completely overlooked, that dialects which diverged
during that early period, would naturally resist every
attempt at genealogical classification. If you remember
the manner in which, for instance, the plural was
formed in Chinese and other languages examined by
us in a former Lecture, you will see that where each
dialect may choose its own term expressive of plurality,
such as <emph>heap</emph>, <emph>class</emph>, <emph>kind</emph>,
<emph>flock</emph>, <emph>cloud</emph>, &amp;c., it would be
unreasonable to expect similarity in grammatical terminations,
after these terms have been ground down
by phonetic corruption to mere exponents of plurality.
But, on the other hand, it would by no means follow
that therefore these languages had no common origin.
Languages may have a common origin, and yet the
words which they originally employed for marking
case, number, person, tense, and mood, having been
totally different, the grammatical terminations to which
these words would gradually dwindle down could not
possibly yield any results if submitted to the analysis
of comparative grammar. A genealogical classification
of such languages is, therefore, from the nature of the
case, simply impossible, at least, if such classification
is chiefly to be based on grammatical or formal
evidence.
</p>

<p>
It might be supposed, however, that such languages,
though differing in their grammatical articulation, would
yet evince their common origin by the identity of their
radicals or roots. No doubt, they will in many instances.
They will probably have retained their numerals
in common, some of their pronouns, and some of the
commonest words of every-day life. But even here we
<pb n='176'/><anchor id='Pg176'/>
must not expect too much, nor be surprised if we find
even less than we expected. You remember how the
names for father varied in the numerous Friesian dialects.
Instead of <emph>frater</emph>, the Latin word for brother,
you find <emph>hermano</emph> in Spanish. Instead of <emph>ignis</emph>, the
Latin word for fire, you have in French <emph>feu</emph>, in Italian,
<emph>fuoco</emph>. Nobody would doubt the common origin of
German and English; yet the English numeral <q>the
first,</q> though preserved in <emph>Fürst</emph>, <emph>prïnceps</emph>, prince,
is quite different from the German <q>Der Erste;</q>
<q>the second</q> is quite different from <q>Der Zweite;</q>
and there is no connection between the possessive pronoun
<emph>its</emph>, and the German <emph>sein</emph>. This dialectical freedom
works on a much larger scale in ancient and illiterate
languages; and those who have most carefully
watched the natural growth of dialects will be the least
surprised that dialects which had the same origin should
differ, not only in their grammatical framework, but
likewise in many of those test-words which are very
properly used for discovering the relationship of literary
languages. How it is possible to say anything
about the relationship of such dialects we shall see
hereafter. For the present, it is sufficient if I have
made it clear why the principle of genealogical classification
is not of necessity applicable to all languages;
and secondly, why languages, though they cannot be
classified genealogically, need not therefore be supposed
to have been different from the beginning. The assertion
so frequently repeated that the impossibility of
classing all languages genealogically proves the impossibility
of a common origin of language, is nothing
but a kind of scientific dogmatism, which, more
than anything else, has impeded the free progress of
independent research.
</p>

<pb n='177'/><anchor id='Pg177'/>

<p>
But let us see now how far the genealogical classification
of languages has advanced, how many families
of human speech have been satisfactorily established.
Let us remember what suggested to us the necessity of
a genealogical classification. We wished to know the
original intention of certain words and grammatical
forms in English, and we saw that before we could
attempt to fathom the origin of such words as <q>I
love,</q> and <q>I loved,</q> we should have to trace them
back to their most primitive state. We likewise found,
by a reference to the history of the Romance dialects,
that words existing in one dialect had frequently been
preserved in a more primitive form in another, and that,
therefore, it was of the highest importance to bring ancient
languages into the same genealogical connection
by which French, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese are
held together as the members of one family.
</p>

<p>
Beginning, therefore, with the living language of
England, we traced it, without difficulty, to Anglo-Saxon.
This carries us back to the seventh century
after Christ, for it is to that date that Kemble and
Thorpe refer the ancient English epic, the Beowulf.
Beyond this we cannot go on English soil. But we
know that the Saxons, the Angles, and Jutes came
from the continent, and there their descendants, along
the northern coast of Germany, still speak <emph>Low-German</emph>,
or Nieder-Deutsch, which in the harbors of Antwerp,
Bremen, and Hamburg, has been mistaken by
many an English sailor for a corrupt English dialect.
The Low-German comprehends many dialects in the
north or the lowlands of Germany; but in Germany
proper they are hardly ever used for literary purposes.
The Friesian dialects are Low-German, so are the
<pb n='178'/><anchor id='Pg178'/>
Dutch and Flemish. The Friesian had a literature
of its own as early at least as the twelfth century,
if not earlier.<note place='foot'><q>Although the
Old Friesian documents rank, according to their dates,
with Middle rather than with Old German, the Friesian language appears
there in a much more ancient stage, which very nearly approaches the Old
High-German. The political isolation of the Friesians, and their noble attachment
to their traditional manners and rights, have imparted to their
language also a more conservative spirit. After the fourteenth century the
old inflections of the Friesian decay most rapidly, whereas in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries they rival the Anglo-Saxon of the ninth and tenth
centuries.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Grimm</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>German Grammar</hi>
(1st ed.), vol. i p. lxviii.</note> The Dutch, which is still a national
and literary language, though confined to a small area,
can be traced back to literary documents of the sixteenth
century. The Flemish, too, was at that time
the language of the court of Flanders and Brabant,
but has since been considerably encroached upon,
though not yet extinguished, by the official languages
of the kingdoms of Holland and Belgium. The oldest
literary document of Low-German on the Continent is
the Christian epic, the <hi rend='italic'>Heljand</hi> (Heljand = Heiland,
the Healer or Saviour), which is preserved to us in
two MSS. of the ninth century, and was written at
that time for the benefit of the newly converted Saxons.
We have traces of a certain amount of literature
in Saxon or Low-German from that time onward
through the Middle Ages up to the seventeenth century.
But little only of that literature has been
preserved; and, after the translation of the Bible by
Luther into High-German, the fate of Low-German
literature was sealed.
</p>

<p>
The literary language of Germany is, and has been
ever since the days of Charlemagne, the <emph>High-German</emph>.
It is spoken in various dialects all over Germany.<note place='foot'>The
dialects of Swabia (the Allemannish), of Bavaria and Austria, of
Franconia along the Main, and of Saxony, &amp;c.</note>
<pb n='179'/><anchor id='Pg179'/>
Its history may be traced through three periods.
The present, or New High-German period dates from
Luther; the Middle High-German period extends
from Luther backwards to the twelfth century; the
Old High-German period extends from thence to the
seventh century.
</p>

<p>
Thus we see that we can follow the High-German,
as well as the Low-German branch of Teutonic speech,
back to about the seventh century after Christ. We
must not suppose that before that time there was <emph>one</emph>
common Teutonic language spoken by all German
tribes, and that it afterwards diverged into two streams,&mdash;the
High and Low. There never was a common,
uniform, Teutonic language; nor is there any evidence
to show that there existed at any time a uniform High-German
or Low-German language, from which all
High-German and Low-German dialects are respectively
derived. We cannot derive Anglo-Saxon, Friesian,
Flemish, Dutch, and Platt-Deutsch from the ancient
Low-German, which is preserved in the continental
Saxon of the ninth century. All we can say is this,
that these various Low-German dialects in England,
Holland, Friesia, and Lower Germany, passed at different
times through the same stages, or, so to say, the
same latitudes of grammatical growth. We may add
that, with every century that we go back, the convergence
of these dialects becomes more and more decided;
but there is no evidence to justify us in admitting the
historical reality of <emph>one</emph> primitive and uniform Low-German
language from which they were all derived. This
is a mere creation of grammarians who cannot understand
a multiplicity of dialects without a common type.
They would likewise demand the admission of a primitive
<pb n='180'/><anchor id='Pg180'/>
High-German language, as the source, not only of
the literary Old, Middle, and Modern High-German,
but likewise of all the local dialects of Austria, Bavaria,
Swabia, and Franconia. And they would wish us
to believe that, previous to the separation into High
and Low German, there existed one complete Teutonic
language, as yet neither High nor Low, but containing
the germs of both. Such a system may be convenient
for the purposes of grammatical analysis, but it becomes
mischievous as soon as these grammatical abstractions
are invested with an historical reality. As there
were families, clans, confederacies, and tribes, before
there was a nation; so there were dialects before there
was a language. The grammarian who postulates an
historical reality for the one primitive type of Teutonic
speech, is no better than the historian who believes in
a <emph>Francus</emph>, the grandson of Hector, and the supposed
ancestor of all the Franks, or in a <emph>Brutus</emph>, the mythical
father of all the Britons. When the German races
descended, one after the other, from the Danube and
from the Baltic, to take possession of Italy and the
Roman provinces,&mdash;when the Goths, the Lombards,
the Vandals, the Franks, the Burgundians, each under
their own kings, and with their own laws and customs,
settled in Italy, Gaul, and Spain, to act their
several parts in the last scene of the Roman tragedy,&mdash;we
have no reason to suppose that they all spoke
one and the same dialect. If we possessed any literary
documents of those ancient German races, we
should find them all dialects again, some with the
peculiarities of High, others with those of Low, German.
Nor is this mere conjecture: for it so happens
that, by some fortunate accident, the dialect of one
<pb n='181'/><anchor id='Pg181'/>
at least of those ancient German races has been preserved
to us in the Gothic translation of the Bible by
Bishop Ulfilas.
</p>

<p>
I must say a few words on this remarkable man.
The accounts of ecclesiastical historians with regard
to the date and the principal events in the life of
Ulfilas are very contradictory. This is partly owing
to the fact that Ulfilas was an Arian bishop, and that
the accounts which we possess of him come from two
opposite sides, from Arian and Athanasian writers.
Although in forming an estimate of his character it
would be necessary to sift this contradictory evidence,
it is but fair to suppose that, when dates and simple
facts in the life of the Bishop have to be settled, his
own friends had better means of information than the
orthodox historians. It is, therefore, from the writings
of his own co-religionists that the chronology and the
historical outline of the Bishop's life should be determined.
</p>

<p>
The principal writers to be consulted are Philostorgius,
as preserved by Photius, and Auxentius, as
preserved by Maximinus in a MS. lately discovered
by Professor Waitz<note place='foot'>Über das Leben
und die Lehre des Ulfila, Hannover, 1840. Über
das Leben des Ulfila von Dr. Bessell, Göttingen, 1860.</note>
in the Library at Paris. (Supplement.
Latin. No. 594.) This MS. contains some
writings of Hilarius, the two first books of Ambrosius
De fide, and the acts of the Council of Aquileja (381).
On the margin of this MS. Maximinus repeated the
beginning of the acts of the Council of Aquileja, adding
remarks of his own in order to show how unfairly
Palladius had been treated in that council by Ambrose.
He jotted down his own views on the Arian
<pb n='182'/><anchor id='Pg182'/>
controversy, and on fol. 282, seq., he copied an account
of Ulfilas written by Auxentius, the bishop of
Dorostorum (Silistria on the Danube), a pupil of
Ulfilas. This is followed again by some dissertations
of Maximinus, and on foll. 314-327, a treatise addressed
to Ambrose by a Semi-arian, a follower of
Eusebius, possibly by Prudentius himself, was copied
and slightly abbreviated for his own purposes by
Maximinus.
</p>

<p>
It is from Auxentius, as copied by Maximinus, that
we learn that Ulfilas died at Constantinople, where he
had been invited by the emperor to a disputation.
This could not have been later than the year 381,
because, according to the same Auxentius, Ulfilas had
been bishop for forty years, and, according to Philostorgius,
he had been consecrated by Eusebius. Now
Eusebius of Nicomedia died 341, and as Philostorgius
says that Ulfilas was consecrated by <q>Eusebius and
the bishops who were with him,</q> the consecration has
been referred with great plausibility to the beginning
of the year 341, when Eusebius presided at the Synod
of Antioch. As Ulfilas was thirty years old at the
time of his consecration, he must have been born in
311, and as he was seventy years of age when he died
at Constantinople, his death must have taken place in
381.
</p>

<p>
Professor Waitz fixed the death of Ulfilas in 388,
because it is stated by Auxentius that other Arian
bishops had come with Ulfilas on his last journey to
Constantinople, and had actually obtained the promise
of a new council from the emperors, but that the
heretical party, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>, the Athanasians, succeeded in
getting a law published, prohibiting all disputation on
<pb n='183'/><anchor id='Pg183'/>
the faith, whether in public or private. Maximinus,
to whom we owe this notice, has added two laws from
the Codex Theodosianus, which he supposed to have
reference to this controversy, dated respectively 388
and 386. This shows that Maximinus himself was
doubtful as to the exact date. Neither of these laws,
however, is applicable to the case, as has been fully
shown by Dr. Bessell. They are quotations from the
Codex Theodosianus made by Maximinus at his own
risk, and made in error. If the death of Ulfilas were
fixed in 388, the important notice of Philostorgius,
that Ulfilas was consecrated by Eusebius, would have
to be surrendered, and we should have to suppose that
as late as 388 Theodosius had been in treaty with the
Arians, whereas after the year 383, when the last
attempt at a reconciliation bad been made by Theodosius,
and had failed, no mercy was any longer shown
to the party of Ulfilas and his friends.
</p>

<p>
If, on the contrary, Ulfilas died at Constantinople
in 381, he might well have been called there by the
Emperor Theodosius, not to a council, but to a disputation
(ad disputationem), as Dr. Bessell ingeniously
maintains, against the Psathyropolistæ,<note place='foot'>Bessell,
l. c. p. 38.</note> a new sect of
Arians at Constantinople. About the same time, in
380, Sozomen<note place='foot'>Sozomenus, H. E.
vii. 6.</note> refers to efforts made by the Arians to
gain influence with Theodosius. He mentions, like
Auxentius, that these efforts were defeated, and a law
published to forbid disputations on the nature of God.
This law exists in the Codex Theodosianus, and is
dated January 10, 381. But what is most important
is, that this law actually revokes a rescript that had
<pb n='184'/><anchor id='Pg184'/>
been obtained fraudulently by the Arian heretics, thus
confirming the statement of Auxentius that the emperor
had held out to him and his party a promise of
a new council.
</p>

<p>
We now return to Ulfilas. He was born in 311.
His parents, as Philostorgius tells us, were of Cappadocian
origin, and had been carried away by the Goths
as captives from a place called Sadagolthina, near the
town of Parnassus. It was under Valerian and Gallienus
(about 267) that the Goths made this raid from
Europe to Asia, Galatia, and Cappadocia, and the
Christian captives whom they carried back to the
Danube were the first to spread the light of the Gospel
among the Goths. Philostorgius was himself a
Cappadocian, and there is no reason to doubt this
statement of his on the parentage of Ulfilas. Ulfilas
was born among the Goths; Gothic was his native
language, though he was able in after-life to speak and
write both in Latin and Greek. Philostorgius, after
speaking of the death of Crispus (326), and before
proceeding to the last years of Constantine, says, that
<q>about that time</q> Ulfilas led his Goths from beyond
the Danube into the Roman empire. They had to
leave their country, being persecuted on account of
their Christianity. Ulfilas was the leader of the faithful
flock, and came to Constantine, (not Constantius,)
as ambassador. This must have been before 337, the
year of Constantine's death. It may have been in
328, when Constantine had gained a victory over the
Goths; and though Ulfilas was then only seventeen
years of age, this would be no reason for rejecting the
testimony of Philostorgius, who says that Constantine
treated Ulfilas with great respect, and called him the
<pb n='185'/><anchor id='Pg185'/>
Moses of his time. Having led his faithful flock
across the Danube into Mœsia, he might well have
been compared by the emperor to Moses leading the
Israelites from Egypt through the Red Sea. It is true
that Auxentius institutes the same comparison between
Ulfilas and Moses, after stating that Ulfilas had been
received with great honors by Constantius. But this
refers to what took place after Ulfilas had been for
seven years bishop among the Goths, in 348, and does
not invalidate the statement of Philostorgius as to the
earlier intercourse between Ulfilas and Constantine.
Sozomen (H. E. vi. 3, 7) clearly distinguishes between
the first crossing of the Danube by the Goths,
with Ulfilas as their ambassador, and the later attacks
of Athanarich on Fridigern or Fritiger, which led to
the settlement of the Goths in the Roman empire. We
must suppose that after having crossed the Danube,
Ulfilas remained for some time with his Goths, or at
Constantinople. Auxentius says that he officiated as
Lector, and it was only when he had reached the
requisite age of thirty, that he was made bishop by
Eusebius in 341. He passed the first seven years of
his episcopate among the Goths, and the remaining
thirty-three of his life <q>in solo Romaniæ,</q> where he
had migrated together with Fritiger and the Thervingi.
There is some confusion as to the exact date
of the Gothic Exodus, but it is not at all unlikely
that Ulfilas acted as their leader on more than one
occasion.
</p>

<p>
There is little more to be learnt about Ulfilas from
other sources. What is said by ecclesiastical historians
about the motives of his adopting the doctrines of
Arius, and his changing from one side to the other,
<pb n='186'/><anchor id='Pg186'/>
deserves no credit. Ulfilas, according to his own confession,
was always an Arian (semper sic credidi).
Socrates says that Ulfilas was present at the Synod
of Constantinople in 360, which may be true, though
neither Auxentius nor Philostorgius mentions it. The
author of the Acts of Nicetas speaks of Ulfilas as
present at the Council of Nicæa, in company with
Theophilus. Theophilus, it is true, signed his name
as a Gothic bishop at that council, but there is nothing
to confirm the statement that Ulfilas, then fourteen
years of age, was with Theophilus.
</p>

<p>
Ulfilas translated the whole Bible, except the Books
of Kings. For the Old Testament he used the Septuagint;
for the New, the Greek text; but not exactly
in that form in which we have it. Unfortunately, the
greater part of his work has been lost, and we have
only considerable portions of the Gospels, all the genuine
Epistles of St. Paul, though again not complete;
fragments of a Psalm, of Ezra, and Nehemiah.<note place='foot'><p>Auxentius
thus speaks of Ulfilas, (Waitz, p. 19:) <q rend='pre'>Et [ita prædic]-ante

<p>
Though Ulfilas belonged to the western Goths, his
translation was used by all Gothic tribes, when they
<pb n='188'/><anchor id='Pg188'/>
advanced into Spain and Italy. The Gothic language
died out in the ninth century, and after the extinction
of the great Gothic empires, the translation of Ulfilas
was lost and forgotten. But a MS. of the fifth century
had been preserved in the Abbey of Werden, and
towards the end of the sixteenth century, a man of the
name of Arnold Mercator, who was in the service of
William IV., the Landgrave of Hessia, drew attention
to this old parchment containing large fragments of the
translation of Ulfilas. The MS., known as the Codex
Argenteus, was afterwards transferred to Prague, and
when Prague was taken in 1648 by Count Königsmark,
he carried this Codex to Upsala in Sweden, where it is
still preserved as one of the greatest treasures. The
parchment is purple, the letters in silver, and the MS.
bound in solid silver.
</p>

<p>
In 1818, Cardinal Mai and Count Castiglione discovered
some more fragments in the Monastery of
Bobbio, where they had probably been preserved ever
since the Gothic empire of Theodoric the Great in Italy
had been destroyed.
</p>

<p>
Ulfilas must have been a man of extraordinary power
to conceive, for the first time, the idea of translating the
Bible into the vulgar language of his people. At his
time, there existed in Europe but two languages which
a Christian bishop would have thought himself justified
in employing, Greek and Latin. All other languages
were still considered as barbarous. It required a prophetic
<pb n='189'/><anchor id='Pg189'/>
sight, and a faith in the destinies of these half-savage
tribes, and a conviction also of the utter effeteness
of the Roman and Byzantine empires, before a bishop
could have brought himself to translate the Bible into
the vulgar dialect of his barbarous countrymen. Soon
after the death of Ulfilas, the number of Christian
Goths at Constantinople had so much increased as to
induce Chrysostom, the bishop of Constantinople (397-405),
to establish a church in the capital, where the
service was to be read in Gothic.<note place='foot'>Theodoret. H. E. V., 30.</note>
</p>

<p>
The language of Ulfilas, the Gothic, belongs, through
its phonetic structure, to the Low-German class, but in
its grammar it is, <emph>with few exceptions</emph>, far more primitive
than the Anglo-Saxon of the Beowulf, or the Old High-German
of Charlemagne. These few exceptions, however,
are very important, for they show that it would
be grammatically, and therefore historically, impossible
to derive either Anglo-Saxon or High-German, or both,<note place='foot'>For
instances where Old High-German is more primitive than Gothic,
see Schleicher, Zeitschrift für V. S., b. iv. s. 266. Bugge, ibid., b. v. s. 59.</note>
from Gothic. It would be impossible, for instance, to
treat the first person plural of the indicative present, the
Old High-German <emph>nerjamês</emph>, as a corruption of the
Gothic <emph>nasjam</emph>; for we know, from the Sanskrit <emph>masi</emph>,
the Greek <emph>mes</emph>, the Latin <emph>mus</emph>, that this was the original
termination of the first person plural.
</p>

<p>
Gothic is but one of the numerous dialects of the
German race; some of which became the feeders of the
literary languages of the British Isles, of Holland,
Friesia, and of Low and High Germany, while others
became extinct, and others rolled on from century to
century unheeded, and without ever producing any
<pb n='190'/><anchor id='Pg190'/>
literature at all. It is because Gothic is the only one
of these parallel dialects that can be traced back to the
fourth century, whereas the others disappear from our
sight in the seventh, that it has been mistaken by some
for the original source of all Teutonic speech. The
same arguments, however, which we used against Raynouard,
to show that Provençal could not be considered
as the parent of the Six Romance dialects, would tell
with equal force against the pretensions of Gothic to be
considered as more than the eldest sister of the Teutonic
branch of speech.
</p>

<p>
There is, in fact, a third stream of Teutonic speech,
which asserts its independence as much as High-German
and Low-German, and which it would be impossible
to place in any but a co-ordinate position with
regard to Gothic, Low and High German. This is the
<emph>Scandinavian</emph> branch. It consists at present of three
literary dialects, those of Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland,
and of various local dialects, particularly in secluded
valleys and fiords of Norway,<note place='foot'>See
Schleicher, Deutsche Sprache, p. 94.</note> where, however,
the literary language is Danish.
</p>

<p>
It is commonly supposed<note place='foot'>Ibid. s. 60.</note>
that, as late as the eleventh
century, identically the same language was spoken in
Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, and that this language
was preserved almost intact in Iceland, while in Sweden
and Denmark it grew into two new national dialects.
Nor is there any doubt that the Icelandic skald recited
his poems in Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, nay,
even among his countrymen in England and Gardariki,
without fear of not being understood, till, as it is said,
William introduced Welsh, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> French, into England,
<pb n='191'/><anchor id='Pg191'/>
and Slavonic tongues grew up in the east.<note place='foot'>Weinhold,
Altnordisches Leben, p. 27; Gunnlaugssaga, c. 7.</note> But though
one and the same language (then called Danish or Norrænish)
was understood, I doubt whether one and the
same language was spoken by all Northmen, and whether
the first germs of Swedish and Danish did not exist long
before the eleventh century, in the dialects of the numerous
clans and tribes of the Scandinavian race. That
race is clearly divided into two branches, called by
Swedish scholars the East and West Scandinavian.
The former would be represented by the old language
of Norway and Iceland, the latter by Swedish and
Danish. This division of the Scandinavian race had
taken place before the Northmen settled in Sweden and
Norway. The western division migrated westward from
Russia, and crossed over from the continent to the
Aland Islands, and from thence to the southern coast of
the peninsula. The eastern division travelled along
the Bothnian Gulf, passing the country occupied by the
Finns and Lapps, and settled in the northern highlands,
spreading toward the south and west.
</p>

<p>
The earliest fragments of Scandinavian speech are
preserved in the two <hi rend='italic'>Eddas</hi>, the elder or poetical Edda,
containing old mythic poems, the younger or Snorri's
Edda giving an account of the ancient mythology in
prose. Both Eddas were composed, not in Norway,
but in Iceland, an island about as large as Ireland, and
which became first known through some Irish monks
who settled there in the eighth century.<note place='foot'>See
Dasent's Burnt Njal, Introduction.</note> In the ninth
century voyages of discovery were made to Iceland by
Naddodd, Gardar, and Flokki, 860-870, and soon after
the distant island, distant about 750 English miles from
<pb n='192'/><anchor id='Pg192'/>
Norway, became a kind of America to the Puritans and
Republicans of the Scandinavian peninsula. Harald
Haarfagr (850-933) had conquered most of the Norwegian
kings, and his despotic sway tended to reduce the
northern freemen to a state of vassalage. Those who
could not resist, and could not bring themselves to yield
to the sceptre of Harald, left their country and migrated
to France, to England, and to Iceland (874). They
were mostly nobles and freemen, and they soon established
in Iceland an aristocratic republic, such as they
had had in Norway before the days of Harald. This
northern republic flourished; it adopted Christianity in
the year 1000. Schools were founded, two bishoprics
were established, and classical literature was studied
with the same zeal with which their own national poems
and laws had been collected and interpreted by native
scholars and historians. The Icelanders were famous
travellers, and the names of Icelandic students are found
not only in the chief cities of Europe, but in the holy
places of the East. At the beginning of the twelfth
century Iceland counted 50,000 inhabitants. Their intellectual
and literary activity lasted to the beginning
of the thirteenth century, when the island was conquered
by Hakon VI., king of Norway. In 1380, Norway,
together with Iceland, was united with Denmark;
and when, in 1814, Norway was ceded to Sweden, Iceland
remained, as it is still, under Danish sway.
</p>

<p>
The old poetry which flourished in Norway in the
eighth century, and which was cultivated by the skalds
in the ninth, would have been lost in Norway itself had
it not been for the jealous care with which it was preserved
by the emigrants of Iceland. The most important
branch of their traditional poetry were short
<pb n='193'/><anchor id='Pg193'/>
songs (hliod or Quida), relating the deeds of their gods
and heroes. It is impossible to determine their age,
but they existed at least previous to the migration of
the Northmen to Iceland, and probably as early as the
seventh century, the same century which yields the
oldest remnants of Anglo-Saxon, Low-German, and
High-German. They were collected in the middle
of the twelfth century by <hi rend='italic'>Saemund Sigfusson</hi> (died
1133). In 1643 a similar collection was discovered
in MSS. of the thirteenth century, and published under
the title of <hi rend='italic'>Edda</hi>, or Great-Grandmother. This
collection is called the old or poetic Edda, in order
to distinguish it from a later work ascribed to Snorri
Sturluson (died 1241). This, the younger or prose
Edda, consists of three parts: the mocking of Gylfi,
the speeches of Bragi, and the Skalda, or <hi rend='italic'>Ars poetica</hi>.
Snorri Sturluson has been called the Herodotus of
Iceland; and his chief work is the <q>Heimskringla,</q>
the world-ring, which contains the northern history
from the mythic times to the time of King Magnus
Erlingsson (died 1177). It was probably in preparing
his history that, like Cassiodorus, Saxo Grammaticus,
Paulus Diaconus, and other historians of the same
class, Snorri collected the old songs of the people; for
his <q>Edda,</q> and particularly his <q>Skalda,</q> are full
of ancient poetic fragments.
</p>

<p>
The <q>Skalda,</q> and the rules which it contains,
represent the state of poetry in the thirteenth century;
and nothing can be more artificial, nothing
more different from the genuine poetry of the old
<q>Edda</q> than this <hi rend='italic'>Ars poetica</hi> of Snorri Sturluson.
One of the chief features of this artificial or skaldic
poetry was this, that nothing should be called by its
<pb n='194'/><anchor id='Pg194'/>
proper name. A ship was not to be called a ship,
but the beast of the sea; blood, not blood, but the
dew of pain, or the water of the sword. A warrior
was not spoken of as a warrior, but as an armed tree,
the tree of battle. A sword was the flame of wounds.
In this poetical language, which every skald was bound
to speak, there were no less than 115 names for Odin;
an island could be called by 120 synonymous titles.
The specimens of ancient poetry which Snorri quotes
are taken from the skalds, whose names are well
known in history, and who lived from the tenth to
the thirteenth century. But he never quotes from
any song contained in the old <q>Edda,</q><note place='foot'>The name
Edda is not found before the fourteenth century. Snorri
Sturluson does not know the word Edda, nor any collection of ancient
poems attributed to Saemund; and though Saemund may have made the
first collection of national poetry, it is doubtful whether the work which we
possess under his name is his.</note> whether it
be that those songs were considered by himself as
belonging to a different and much more ancient period
of literature, or that they could not be used in illustration
of the scholastic rules of skaldic poets, these
very rules being put to shame by the simple style of
the national poetry, which expressed what it had to
express without effort and circumlocution.
</p>

<p>
We have thus traced the modern Teutonic dialects
back to four principal channels,&mdash;the <emph>High-German</emph>,
<emph>Low-German</emph>, <emph>Gothic</emph>, and <emph>Scandinavian</emph>; and we have
seen that these four, together with several minor dialects,
must be placed in a co-ordinate position from
the beginning, as so many varieties of Teutonic speech.
This Teutonic speech may, for convenience' sake, be
spoken of as one,&mdash;as one branch of that great family
of language to which, as we shall see, it belongs; but
<pb n='195'/><anchor id='Pg195'/>
it should always be borne in mind that this primitive
and uniform language never had any real historical
existence, and that, like all other languages, that of
the Germans began with dialects which gradually
formed themselves into several distinct national deposits.
</p>

<p>
We must now advance more rapidly, and, instead
of the minuteness of an Ordnance-map, we must be
satisfied with the broad outlines of Wyld's Great Globe
in our survey of the languages which, together with the
Teutonic, form the Indo-European or Aryan family of
speech.
</p>

<p>
And first the Romance, or modern Latin languages.
Leaving mere local dialects out of sight, we have at
present six literary modifications of Latin, or more
correctly, of ancient Italian,&mdash;the languages of Portugal,
of Spain, of France, of Italy, of Wallachia,<note place='foot'><p>The
people whom we call Wallachians, call themselves Romàni, and
their language Romània.
</p>
<p>
This Romance language is spoken in Wallachia and Moldavia, and in
parts of Hungary, Transylvania, and Bessarabia. On the right bank of
the Danube it occupies some parts of the old Thracia, Macedonia, and even
Thessaly.
</p>
<p>
It is divided by the Danube into two branches: the Northern or Daco-romanic,
and the Southern or Macedo-romanic. The former is less mixed,
and has received a certain literary culture; the latter has borrowed a larger
number of Albanian and Greek words, and has never been fixed grammatically.
</p>
<p>
The modern Wallachian is the daughter of the language spoken in the
Roman province of Dacia.
</p>
<p>
The original inhabitants of Dacia were called Thracians, and their language
Illyrian. We have hardly any remains of the ancient Illyrian language
to enable us to form an opinion as to its relationship with Greek or
any other family of speech.
</p>
<p>
219 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, the Romans conquered Illyria; 30
<hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, they took Moesia; and 107
<hi rend='smallcaps'>a. d.</hi>, the Emperor Trajan made Dacia a Roman province. At that
time the Thracian population had been displaced by the advance of Sarmatian
tribes, particularly the Yazyges. Roman colonists introduced the
Latin language; and Dacia was maintained as a colony up to 272, when
the Emperor Aurelian had to cede it to the Goths. Part of the Roman inhabitants
then emigrated and settled south of the Danube.
</p>
<p>
In 489 the Slavonic tribes began their advance into Mœsia and Thracia.
They were settled in Mœsia by 678, and eighty years later a province was
founded in Macedonia, under the name of Slavinia.</p></note> and
<pb n='196'/><anchor id='Pg196'/>
of the Grisons of Switzerland, called the Roumansch
or Romanese.<note place='foot'>The entire Bible has been published by the Bible Society
in Romanese, for the Grisons in Switzerland; and in Lower Romanese, or Enghadine,
as spoken on the borders of the Tyrol.</note> The Provençal, which, in the poetry
of the Troubadours, attained at a very early time to a
high literary excellence, has now sunk down to a mere
<hi rend='italic'>patois</hi>. The earliest Provençal poem, the Song of
Boëthius, is generally referred to the tenth century:
Le Bœuf referred it to the eleventh. But in the lately
discovered Song of Eulalia, we have now a specimen
of the Langue d'Oil, or the ancient Northern French,
anterior in date to the earliest poetic specimen of the
Langue d'Oc, or the ancient Provençal. Nothing
can be a better preparation for the study of the comparative
grammar of the ancient Aryan languages than
a careful perusal of the <q>Comparative Grammar of the
Six Romance Languages</q> by Professor Diez.
</p>

<p>
Though in a general way we trace these six Romance
languages back to Latin, yet it has been pointed out before
that the classical Latin would fail to supply a complete
explanation of their origin. Many of the ingredients
of the Neo-Latin dialects must be sought for in
the ancient dialects of Italy and her provinces. More
than one dialect of Latin was spoken there before the
rise of Rome, and some important fragments have been
preserved to us, in inscriptions, of the Umbrian spoken
in the north, and of the Oscan spoken to the south of
Rome. The Oscan language, spoken by the Samnites,
now rendered intelligible by the labors of Mommsen,
<pb n='197'/><anchor id='Pg197'/>
had produced a literature before the time of Livius
Andronicus; and the tables of Iguvio, so elaborately
treated by Aufrecht and Kirchhoff, bear witness to a
priestly literature among the Umbrians at a very early
period. Oscan was still spoken under the Roman emperors,
and so were minor local dialects in the south
and the north. As soon as the literary language of
Rome became classical and unchangeable, the first
start was made in the future career of those dialects
which, even at the time of Dante, are still called <emph>vulgar</emph>
or <emph>popular</emph>.<note place='foot'><q>Ed il primo,
così Dante, che cominciò a dire come poeta volgare, si
mosse, perocchè volle far intendere le sue parole a donna alla quale era
malagevole ad intendere versi Latini.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Vita
Nuova</hi>.</note> A great deal, no doubt, of the corruption
of these modern dialects is due to the fact that,
in the form in which we know them after the eighth
century, they are really Neo-Latin dialects as adopted
by the Teutonic barbarians; full, not only of Teutonic
words, but of Teutonic idioms, phrases, and constructions.
French is provincial Latin as spoken by the
Franks, a Teutonic race; and, to a smaller extent, the
same <emph>barbarizing</emph> has affected all other Roman dialects.
But from the very beginning, the stock with which the
Neo-Latin dialects started was not the classical Latin, but
the vulgar, local, provincial dialects of the middle, the
lower, and the lowest classes of the Roman Empire.
Many of the words which give to French and Italian
their classical appearance, are really of much later
date, and were imported into them by mediæval scholars,
lawyers, and divines; thus escaping the rough
treatment to which the original vulgar dialects were
subjected by the Teutonic conquerors.
</p>

<p>
The next branch of the Indo-European family of
<pb n='198'/><anchor id='Pg198'/>
speech is the <emph>Hellenic</emph>. Its history is well known from
the time of Homer to the present day. The only remark
which the comparative philologist has to make is
that the idea of making Greek the parent of Latin, is
more preposterous than deriving English from German;
the fact being that there are many forms in Latin more
primitive than their corresponding forms in Greek.
The idea of Pelasgians as the common ancestors of
Greeks and Romans is another of those grammatical
mythes, but hardly requires at present any serious refutation.
</p>

<p>
The fourth branch of our family is the <emph>Celtic</emph>. The
Celts seem to have been the first of the Aryans to arrive
in Europe; but the pressure of subsequent migrations,
particularly of Teutonic tribes, has driven them
towards the westernmost parts, and latterly from Ireland
across the Atlantic. At present the only remaining
dialects are the Kymric and Gadhelic. The <emph>Kymric</emph>
comprises the <emph>Welsh</emph>; the <emph>Cornish</emph>, lately extinct;
and the <emph>Armorican</emph>, of Brittany. The <emph>Gadhelic</emph> comprises
the <emph>Irish</emph>; the <emph>Galic</emph> of the west coast of Scotland;
and the dialect of the <emph>Isle of Man</emph>. Although
these Celtic dialects are still spoken, the Celts themselves
can no longer be considered an independent
nation, like the Germans or Slaves. In former times,
however, they not only enjoyed political autonomy, but
asserted it successfully against Germans and Romans.
Gaul, Belgium, and Britain were Celtic dominions,
and the north of Italy was chiefly inhabited by them.
In the time of Herodotus we find Celts in Spain; and
Switzerland, the Tyrol, and the country south of the
Danube have once been the seats of Celtic tribes. But
after repeated inroads into the regions of civilization,
<pb n='199'/><anchor id='Pg199'/>
familiarizing Latin and Greek writers with the names
of their kings, they disappear from the east of Europe.
Brennus is supposed to mean king, the Welsh <emph>brennin</emph>.
A Brennus conquered Rome (390), another Brennus
threatened Delphi (280). And about the same time a
Celtic colony settled in Asia, and founded Galatia, where
the language spoken at the time of St. Jerome was
still that of the Gauls. Celtic words may be found in
German, Slavonic, and even in Latin, but only as
foreign terms, and their amount is much smaller than
commonly supposed. A far larger number of Latin
and German words have since found their way into
the modern Celtic dialects, and these have frequently
been mistaken by Celtic enthusiasts for original words,
from which German and Latin might, in their turn, be
derived.
</p>

<p>
The fifth branch, which is commonly called <emph>Slavonic</emph>,
I prefer to designate by the name of <emph>Windic</emph>, <emph>Winidae</emph>
being one of the most ancient and comprehensive
names by which these tribes were known to the early
historians of Europe. We have to divide these tribes
into two divisions, the <emph>Lettic</emph> and the <emph>Slavonic</emph>, and we
shall have to subdivide the Slavonic again into a <emph>South-East
Slavonic</emph> and a <emph>West Slavonic</emph> branch.
</p>

<p>
The <emph>Lettic</emph> division consists of languages hardly known
to the student of literature, but of great importance to
the student of language. <emph>Lettish</emph> is the language now
spoken in Kurland and Livonia. <emph>Lithuanian</emph> is the
name given to a language still spoken by about 200,000
people in Eastern Prussia, and by more than a million
of people in the coterminous parts of Russia. The
earliest literary document of Lithuanian is a small catechism
of 1547.<note place='foot'>Schleicher, Beiträge, i. 19.</note>
In this, and even in the language as
<pb n='200'/><anchor id='Pg200'/>
now spoken by the Lithuanian peasant, there are some
grammatical forms more primitive, and more like Sanskrit,
than the corresponding forms in Greek and Latin.
</p>

<p>
The <emph>Old Prussian</emph>, which is nearly related to Lithuanian,
became extinct in the seventeenth century,
and the entire literature which it has left behind consists
in an old catechism.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Lettish</emph> is the language of Kurland and Livonia, more
modern in its grammar than Lithuanian, yet not immediately
derived from it.
</p>

<p>
We now come to the <emph>Slavonic</emph> languages, properly so
called. The eastern branch comprehends the <emph>Russian</emph>
with various local dialects; the <emph>Bulgarian</emph>, and the
<emph>Illyrian</emph>. The most ancient document of this eastern
branch is the so-called Ecclesiastical Slavonic, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> the
ancient Bulgarian, into which Cyrillus and Methodius
translated the Bible, in the middle of the ninth century.
This is still the authorized version<note place='foot'>Oldest
dated MS. of 1056, written for Prince Ostromir. Some older
written with Glagolitic letters. Schleicher, Beiträge, b. i. s. 20.</note> of the Bible
for the whole Slavonic race; and to the student of the
Slavonic languages, it is what Gothic is to the student
of German. The modern Bulgarian, on the contrary,
as far as grammatical forms are concerned, is the most
reduced among the Slavonic dialects.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Illyrian</emph> is a convenient or inconvenient name to
comprehend the <emph>Servian</emph>, <emph>Croatian</emph>,
and <emph>Slovinian</emph> dialects.
Literary fragments of <emph>Slovinian</emph> go back as far
as the tenth century.<note place='foot'>Schleicher, s. 22.</note>
</p>

<p>
The western branch comprehends the language of
<emph>Poland</emph>, <emph>Bohemia</emph>, and <emph>Lusatia</emph>. The oldest specimen
of Polish belongs to the fourteenth century: the Psalter
<pb n='201'/><anchor id='Pg201'/>
of Margarite. The Bohemian language was, till
lately, traced back to the ninth century. But most of
these old Bohemian poems are now considered spurious;
and it is doubtful, even, whether an ancient interlinear
translation of the Gospel of St. John can be ascribed
to the tenth century.<note place='foot'>Schleicher, Deutsche Sprache, s. 77.</note>
</p>

<p>
The language of Lusatia is spoken, probably, by no
more than 150,000 people, known in Germany by the
name of <emph>Wends</emph>.
</p>

<p>
We have examined all the languages of our first or
Aryan family, which are spoken in Europe, with one
exception, the <emph>Albanian</emph>. This language is clearly a
member of the same family; and as it is sufficiently
distinct from Greek or any other recognized language,
it has been traced back to one of the neighboring races
of the Greeks, the Illyrians, and is supposed to be the
only surviving representative of the various so-called
barbarous tongues which surrounded and interpenetrated
the dialects of Greece.
</p>

<p>
We now pass on from Europe to Asia; and here we
begin at once, on the extreme south, with the languages
of India. As I sketched the history of Sanskrit
in one of my former Lectures, it must suffice, at
present, to mark the different periods of that language,
beginning, about 1500 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, with the dialect of the
Vedas, which is followed by the modern Sanskrit; the
popular dialects of the third century <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>; the Prakrit
dialects of the plays; and the spoken dialects, such
as Hindí, Hindústání, Mahrattí, Bengalí. There are
many points of great interest to the student of language,
in the long history of the speech of India; and
it has been truly said that Sanskrit is to the science of
<pb n='202'/><anchor id='Pg202'/>
language what mathematics are to astronomy. In an
introductory course of lectures, however, like the present,
it would be out of place to enter on a minute
analysis of the grammatical organism of this language
of languages.
</p>

<p>
There is one point only on which I may be allowed
to say a few words. I have frequently been asked,
<q>But how can you prove that Sanskrit literature is so
old as it is supposed to be? How can you fix any
Indian dates before the time of Alexander's conquest?
What dependence can be placed on Sanskrit manuscripts
which may have been forged or interpolated?</q>
It is easier to ask such questions than to answer them,
at least to answer them briefly and intelligibly. But,
perhaps, the following argument will serve as a partial
answer, and show that Sanskrit was the spoken language
of India at least some centuries before the time
of Solomon. In the hymns of the Veda, which are
the oldest literary compositions in Sanskrit, the geographical
horizon of the poets is, for the greater part,
limited to the north-west of India. There are very few
passages in which any allusions to the sea or the sea-coast
occur, whereas the snowy mountains, and the rivers
of the Penjáb, and the scenery of the Upper Ganges
valley are familiar objects to the ancient bards. There
is no doubt, in fact, that the people who spoke Sanskrit
came into India from the north, and gradually
extended their sway to the south and east. Now, at the
time of Solomon, it can be proved that Sanskrit was
spoken at least as far south as the mouth of the Indus.
</p>

<p>
You remember the fleet of Tharshish<note place='foot'>1
Kings viii. 21.</note> which Solomon
had at sea, together with the navy of Hiram, and
<pb n='203'/><anchor id='Pg203'/>
which came once in three years, bringing <emph>gold</emph> and
<emph>silver</emph>, <emph>ivory</emph>, <emph>apes</emph>,
and <emph>peacocks</emph>. The same navy,
which was stationed on the shore of the Red Sea, is
said to have fetched gold from <emph>Ophir</emph>,<note place='foot'>1
Kings ix. 26.</note> and to have
brought, likewise, great plenty of <emph>algum</emph><note place='foot'>1
Kings x. 11.</note> trees and
precious stones from Ophir.
</p>

<p>
Well, a great deal has been written to find out
where this Ophir was; but there can be no doubt
that it was in India. The names for <emph>apes</emph>, <emph>peacocks</emph>,
<emph>ivory</emph> and <emph>algum</emph>-trees are foreign words in Hebrew, as
much as <emph>gutta-percha</emph> or <emph>tobacco</emph> are in English. Now,
if we wished to know from what part of the world
<emph>gutta-percha</emph> was first imported into England, we might
safely conclude that it came from that country where
the name, <emph>gutta-percha</emph>, formed part of the
spoken language.<note place='foot'><emph>Gutta</emph> in
Malay means <emph>gum</emph>, <emph>percha</emph> is the name of the tree (Isonandra
gutta), or of an island from which the tree was first imported (Pulo-percha).</note>
If, therefore, we can find a language in which
the names for peacock, apes, ivory, and algum-tree,
which are foreign in Hebrew, are indigenous, we may
be certain that the country in which that language
was spoken must have been the Ophir of the Bible.
That language is no other but Sanskrit.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Apes</emph> are called, in Hebrew, <emph>koph</emph>, a word without an
etymology in the Semitic languages, but nearly identical
in sound with the Sanskrit name of ape, <emph>kapi</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Ivory</emph> is called either <emph>karnoth-shen</emph>, horns of tooth;
or <emph>shen habbim</emph>. This <emph>habbim</emph> is again without a derivation
in Hebrew, but it is most likely a corruption of
the Sanskrit name for elephant, <emph>ibha</emph>, preceded by the
Semitic article.<note place='foot'>See Lassen, Indische
Alterthumskunde, b. i. s. 537.</note>
</p>

<pb n='204'/><anchor id='Pg204'/>

<p>
<emph>Peacocks</emph> are called in Hebrew <emph>tukhi-im</emph>, and this
finds its explanation in the name still used for peacock
on the coast of Malabar, <emph>togëi</emph>, which in turn has been
derived from the Sanskrit <emph>śikhin</emph>, meaning furnished
with a crest.
</p>

<p>
All these articles, ivory, gold, apes, peacocks, are
indigenous in India, though of course they might have
been found in other countries likewise. Not so the
<emph>algum-tree</emph>, at least if interpreters are right in taking
<emph>algum</emph> or <emph>almug</emph> for sandalwood. Sandalwood is found
indigenous on the coast of Malabar only; and one of
its numerous names there, and in Sanskrit, is <emph>valguka</emph>.
This <emph>valgu</emph>(<emph>ka</emph>) is clearly the name which Jewish and
Phœnician merchants corrupted into <emph>algum</emph>, and which
in Hebrew was still further changed into <emph>almug</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Now, the place where the navy of Solomon and
Hiram, coming down the Red Sea, would naturally
have landed, was the mouth of the Indus. There
<emph>gold</emph> and <emph>precious stones</emph> from the north would have
been brought down the Indus; and <emph>sandalwood</emph>, <emph>peacocks</emph>,
and <emph>apes</emph> would have been brought from Central
and Southern India. In this very locality Ptolemy
(vii. 1) gives us the name of <emph>Abiria</emph>, above <emph>Pattalene</emph>.
In the same locality Hindu geographers place the people
called <emph>Abhîra</emph> or <emph>Âbhîra</emph>; and in the same neighborhood
MacMurdo, in his account of the province of
Cutch, still knows a race of <emph>Ahirs</emph>,<note place='foot'>See
also Sir Henry Elliot's Supplementary Glossary, s. v. Aheer.</note> the descendants, in
all probability, of the people who sold to Hiram and
Solomon their gold and precious stones, their apes,
peacocks, and sandalwood.<note place='foot'>The arguments brought
forward by Quatremère in his <q>Mémoire sur
le Pays d'Ophir</q> against fixing Ophir on the Indian coast are
not conclusive. The arguments derived from the names of the articles exported from
Ophir were unknown to him. It is necessary to mention this, because
Quatremère's name carries great weight, and his essay on Ophir has lately
been republished in the Bibliothèque Classique des Célébrités Contemporaines.

</p>

<pb n='205'/><anchor id='Pg205'/>

<p>
If, then, in the Veda the people who spoke Sanskrit
were still settled in the north of India, whereas
at the time of Solomon their language had extended
to Cutch and even the Malabar coast, this will show
that at all events Sanskrit is not of yesterday, and
that it is as old, at least, as the book of Job, in which
the gold of Ophir is mentioned.<note place='foot'>Job xxii. 24.</note>

Most closely allied to Sanskrit, more particularly to
the Sanskrit of the Veda, is the ancient language of
the Zend-avesta,<note place='foot'><emph>Zend-avesta</emph>
is the name used by Chaqâni and other Muhammedan
writers. The Parsis use the name <q><emph>Avesta</emph> and <emph>Zend</emph>,</q>
taking <emph>Avesta</emph> in the sense of text, and
<emph>Zend</emph> as the title of the Pehlevi commentary. I doubt, however, whether this
was the original meaning of the word <emph>Zend</emph>. <emph>Zend</emph>
was more likely the same word as the Sanskrit <emph>chhandas</emph> (scandere) a name
given to the Vedic hymns, and <emph>avesta</emph>, the Sanskrit <emph>avasthâna</emph>, a
word which, though it does not occur in Sanskrit, would mean settled text.
<emph>Avasthita</emph>, in Sanskrit, means laid down, settled. The Zend-avesta now
consists of four books, Yasna, Vispered, Yashts, and Vendidad (Vendidad
= vidaeva dâta; in Pehlevi, Juddivdad). Dr. Haug, in his interesting
lecture on the <q>Origin of the Parsee Religion,</q> Bombay, 1861, takes
<emph>Avesta</emph> in the sense of the most ancient texts, <emph>Zend</emph> as
commentary, and <emph>Pazend</emph> as explanatory notes, all equally written in what we
shall continue to call the Zend language.</note> the so-called <emph>Zend</emph>, or
sacred language of the Zoroastrians or Fire-worshippers. It
was, in fact, chiefly through the Sanskrit, and with
the help of comparative philology, that the ancient
dialect of the Parsis or Fire-worshippers was deciphered.
The MSS. had been preserved by the Parsi
priests at Bombay, where a colony of fire-worshippers
had fled in the tenth century,<note place='foot'><q>According to
the Kissah-i-Sanján, a tract almost worthless as a
record of the early history of the Parsis, the fire-worshippers took refuge
in Khorassan forty-nine years before the era of Yezdegerd
(632 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a. d.</hi>), or
about 583. Here they stayed 100 years, to 683, then departed to the city
of Hormaz (Ormus, in the Persian Gulf), and after staying fifteen years,
proceeded in 698 to Diu, an island on the south-west coast of Katiawar.
Here they remained nineteen years, to 717, and then proceeded to Sanján,
a town about twenty-four miles south of Damaun. After 300 years they
spread to the neighboring towns of Guzerat, and established the sacred fire
successively at Barsadah, Nauśari, near Surat, and
Bombay.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Bombay
Quarterly Review</hi>, 1856, No. viii. p. 67.</note> and where it has
<pb n='206'/><anchor id='Pg206'/>
risen since to considerable wealth and influence.
Other settlements of Guebres are to be found in
Yezd and parts of Kerman. A Frenchman, Anquetil
Duperron, was the first to translate the Zend-avesta,
but his translation was not from the original, but from
a modern Persian translation. The first European
who attempted to read the original words of Zoroaster
was Rask, the Dane; and after his premature death,
Burnouf, in France, achieved one of the greatest triumphs
in modern scholarship by deciphering the language
of the Zend-avesta, and establishing its close
relationship with Sanskrit. The same doubts which
were expressed about the age and the genuineness of
the Veda, were repeated with regard to the Zend-avesta,
by men of high authority as oriental scholars,
by Sir W. Jones himself, and even by the late Professor
Wilson. But Burnouf's arguments, based at
first on grammatical evidence only, were irresistible,
and have of late been most signally confirmed by the
discovery of the cuneiform inscriptions of Darius and
Xerxes. That there was a Zoroaster, an ancient sage,
was known long before Burnouf. Plato speaks of a
teacher of Zoroaster's Magic (Μαγεία), and calls Zoroaster
the son of <emph>Oromazes</emph>.<note place='foot'> Alc. i.
p. 122, <hi rend='italic'>a</hi>. Ὁ μὲν μαγείαν διδάσκει τὴν
Ζωροάστρου τοῦ
Ὠρομάζον; ἔστι δὲ τοῦτο θεῶν θεραπεία.</note>
</p>

<p>
This name of Oromazes is important; for Oromazes
<pb n='207'/><anchor id='Pg207'/>
is clearly meant for <emph>Ormuzd</emph>, the god of the Zoroastrians.
The name of this god, as read in the inscriptions
of Darius and Xerxes, is <emph>Auramazdâ</emph>, which comes
very near to Plato's Oromazes.<note place='foot'>In the
inscriptions we find, nom. <emph>Auramazdâ</emph>, gen. <emph>Auramazdâha</emph>, acc.
<emph>Auramazdam</emph>.</note> Thus Darius says,
in one passage: <q>Through the grace of Auramazda I
am king; Auramazda gave me the kingdom.</q> But
what is the meaning of <emph>Auramazda</emph>? We receive a
hint from one passage in the Achæmenian inscriptions,
where Auramazda is divided into two words, both
being declined. The genitive of Auramazda occurs
there as <emph>Aurahya mazdâha</emph>. But even this is unintelligible,
and is, in fact, nothing but a phonetic corruption
of the name of the supreme Deity as it occurs
on every page of the Zend-avesta, namely, <emph>Ahurô
mazdâo</emph> (nom.). Here, too, both words are declined;
and instead of <emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph>, we also find <emph>Mazdâo
ahurô</emph>.<note place='foot'>Gen. <emph>Ahurahe mazdâo</emph>, dat.
<emph>mazdâi</emph>, acc. <emph>mazdam</emph>.</note>
Well, this <emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph> is represented in
the Zend-avesta as the creator and ruler of the world;
as good, holy, and true; and as doing battle against
all that is evil, dark, and false. <q>The wicked perish
through the wisdom and holiness of the living wise
Spirit.</q> In the oldest hymns, the power of darkness,
which is opposed to <emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph> has not yet received
its proper name, which is <emph>Angrô mainyus</emph>, the
later <emph>Ahriman</emph>; but it is spoken of as a power, as <emph>Drukhs</emph>
or deceit; and the principal doctrine which Zoroaster
came to preach was that we must choose between these
two powers, that we must be good, and not bad. These
are his words:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>In the beginning there was a pair of twins, two
<pb n='208'/><anchor id='Pg208'/>
spirits, each of a peculiar activity. These are the
Good and the Base in thought, word, and deed.
Choose one of these two spirits; Be good, not
base!</q><note place='foot'>Haug, Lecture, p. 11; and in Bunsen's Egypt.</note>
</p>

<p>
Or again:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>Ahuramazda is holy, true, to be honored through
veracity, through holy deeds.</q> <q>You cannot serve
both.</q>
</p>

<p>
Now, if we wanted to prove that Anglo-Saxon was
a real language, and more ancient than English, a mere
comparison of a few words such as <emph>lord</emph> and <emph>hlafford</emph>,
<emph>gospel</emph> and <emph>godspel</emph> would be
sufficient. <emph>Hlafford</emph> has a
meaning; <emph>lord</emph> has none; therefore we may safely say
that without such a compound as <emph>hlafford</emph>, the word
<emph>lord</emph> could never have arisen. The same, if we compare
the language of the Zend-avesta with that of the
cuneiform inscriptions of Darius. <emph>Auramazdâ</emph> is clearly
a corruption of <emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph>, and if the language of
the Mountain-records of Behistun is genuine, then, <hi rend='italic'>à
fortiori</hi>, is the language of the Zend-avesta genuine, as
deciphered by Burnouf, long before he had deciphered
the language of Cyrus and Darius. But what is the
meaning of <emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph>? Here Zend does not give
us an answer; but we must look to Sanskrit, as the
more primitive language, just as we looked from French
to Italian, in order to discover the original form and
meaning of <emph>feu</emph>. According to the rules which govern
the changes of words, common to Zend and Sanskrit,
<emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph> corresponds to the Sanskrit <emph>Asuro medhas</emph>;
and this would mean the <q>Wise Spirit,</q> neither
more nor less.
</p>

<p>
We have editions, translations, and commentaries of
<pb n='209'/><anchor id='Pg209'/>
the Zend-avesta by Burnouf, Brockhaus, Spiegel, and
Westergaard. Yet there still remains much to be done.
Dr. Haug, now settled at Poona, has lately taken up
the work which Burnouf left unfinished. He has
pointed out that the text of the Zend-avesta, as we
have it, comprises fragments of very different antiquity,
and that the most ancient only, the so-called Gâthâs,
can be ascribed to Zarathustra. <q>This portion,</q> he
writes in a lecture just received from India, <q>compared
with the whole bulk of the Zend fragments is very
small; but by the difference of dialect it is easily
recognized. The most important pieces written in
this peculiar dialect are called Gâthâs or songs, arranged
in five small collections; they have different
metres, which mostly agree with those of the Veda;
their language is very near to the Vedic dialect.</q> It
is to be regretted that in the same lecture, which holds
out the promise of so much that will be extremely valuable,
Dr. Haug should have lent his authority to the
opinion that Zoroaster or Zarathustra is mentioned in
the Rig-Veda as Jaradashṭi. The meaning of jaradashti
in the Rig-Veda may be seen in the Sanskrit
Dictionary of the Russian Academy, and no Sanskrit
scholar would seriously think of translating the word
by Zoroaster.
</p>

<p>
At what time Zoroaster lived, is a more difficult
question which we cannot discuss at present.<note place='foot'><p>Berosus, as
preserved in the Armenian translation of Eusebius, mentions
a Median dynasty of Babylon, beginning with a king Zoroaster, long
before Ninus; his date would be 2234 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>
</p>
<p>
Xanthus, the Lydian (470 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>), as quoted by Diogenes
Laertius, places Zoroaster, the prophet, 600 before the Trojan war
(1800 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>).
</p>
<p>
Aristotle and Eudoxus, according to Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxx. 1), placed
Zoroaster 6000 before Plato; Hermippus 5000 before the Trojan war (Diog.
Laert. proœm.).
</p>
<p>
Pliny (Hist. Nat. xxx. 2) places Zoroaster several thousand years before
Moses the Judæan, who founded another kind of Mageia.</p></note> It must
<pb n='210'/><anchor id='Pg210'/>
suffice if we have proved that he lived, and that his
language, the Zend, is a real language, and anterior
in time to the language of the cuneiform inscriptions.
</p>

<p>
We trace the subsequent history of the Persian language
from Zend to the inscriptions of the Achæmenian
dynasty; from thence to what is called <emph>Pehlevi</emph> or <emph>Huzvaresh</emph>
(better Huzûresh), the language of the Sassanian
dynasty (226-651), as it is found in the dialect of
the translations of the Zend-avesta, and in the official
language of the Sassanian coins and inscriptions. This
is considerably mixed with Semitic elements, probably
imported from Syria. In a still later form, freed also
from the Semitic elements which abound in Pehlevi,
the language of Persia appears again as <emph>Parsi</emph>, which
differs but little from the language of <emph>Firdusi</emph>, the great
epic poet of Persia, the author of the Shahnámeh, about
1000 <hi rend='smallcaps'>a. d.</hi> The later history of Persian consists entirely
in the gradual increase of Arabic words, which
have crept into the language since the conquest of Persia
and the conversion of the Persians to the religion
of Mohammed.
</p>

<p>
The other languages which evince by their grammar
and vocabulary a general relationship with Sanskrit
and Persian, but which have received too distinct and
national a character to be classed as mere dialects, are
the languages <emph>of Afghanistan</emph> or the <emph>Pushtú</emph>, the language
of <emph>Bokhára</emph>, the language of the <emph>Kurds</emph>, the <emph>Ossetian</emph>
language in the Caucasus, and the <emph>Armenian</emph>. Much
might be said on every one of these tongues and their
claims to be classed as independent members of the
<pb n='211'/><anchor id='Pg211'/>
Aryan family; but our time is limited, nor has any one
of them acquired, as yet, that importance which belongs
to the vernaculars of India, Persia, Greece, Italy, and
Germany, and to other branches of Aryan speech which
have been analyzed critically, and may be studied historically
in the successive periods of their literary existence.
There is, however, one more language which
we have omitted to mention, and which belongs equally
to Asia and Europe, the language of the <emph>Gipsies</emph>. This
language, though most degraded in its grammar, and
with a dictionary stolen from all the countries through
which the Zingaris passed, is clearly an exile from Hindústán.
</p>

<p>
You see, from the diagram before you,<note place='foot'>Printed
at the end of these Lectures.</note> that it is
possible to divide the whole Aryan family into two
divisions: the <emph>Southern</emph>, including the Indic and Iranic
classes, and the <emph>Northern</emph> or <emph>North-western</emph>, comprising
all the rest. Sanskrit and Zend share certain words
and grammatical forms in common which do not exist
in any of the other Aryan languages; and there can
be no doubt that the ancestors of the poets of the Veda
and of the worshippers of <emph>Ahurô mazdâo</emph> lived together
for some time after they had left the original home of
the whole Aryan race. For let us see this clearly:
the genealogical classification of languages, as drawn
in this diagram, has an historical meaning. As sure as
the six Romance dialects point to an original home of
Italian shepherds on the seven hills at Rome, the Aryan
languages together point to an earlier period of language,
when the first ancestors of the Indians, the Persians,
the Greeks, the Romans, the Slaves, the Celts,
and the Germans were living together within the same
<pb n='212'/><anchor id='Pg212'/>
enclosures, nay under the same roof. There was a
time when out of many possible names for <emph>father</emph>, <emph>mother</emph>,
<emph>daughter</emph>, <emph>son</emph>, <emph>dog</emph> and
<emph>cow</emph>, <emph>heaven</emph> and <emph>earth</emph>, those
which we find in all the Aryan languages were framed,
and obtained a mastery <emph>in the struggle for life</emph> which is
carried on among synonymous words as much as among
plants and animals. Look at the comparative table of
the auxiliary verb AS, to be, in the different Aryan
languages. The selection of the root AS out of many
roots, equally applicable to the idea of being, and the
joining of this root with one set of personal terminations,
all originally personal pronouns, were individual
acts, or if you like, historical events. They took place
once, at a certain date and in a certain place; and as
we find the same forms preserved by all the members
of the Aryan family, it follows that before the ancestors
of the Indians and Persians started for the south, and
the leaders of the Greek, Roman, Celtic, Teutonic,
and Slavonic colonies marched towards the shores of
Europe, there was a small clan of Aryans, settled probably
on the highest elevation of Central Asia, speaking
a language, not yet Sanskrit or Greek or German, but
containing the dialectical germs of all; a clan that had
advanced to a state of agricultural civilization; that
had recognized the bonds of blood, and sanctioned the
bonds of marriage; and that invoked the Giver of
Light and Life in heaven by the same name which you
may still hear in the temples of Benares, in the basilicas
of Rome, and in our own churches and cathedrals.
</p>

<p>
After this clan broke up, the ancestors of the Indians
and Zoroastrians must have remained together for some
time in their migrations or new settlements; and I believe
that it was the reform of Zoroaster which produced
<pb n='213'/><anchor id='Pg213'/>
at last the split between the worshippers of the Vedic
gods and the worshippers of Ormuzd. Whether, besides
this division into a southern and northern branch, it is
possible by the same test (the community of particular
words and forms), to discover the successive periods
when the Germans separated from the Slaves, the Celts
from the Italians, or the Italians from the Greeks, seems
more than doubtful. The attempts made by different
scholars have led to different and by no means satisfactory
results;<note place='foot'>See Schleicher, Deutsche
Sprache, s. 81.</note> and it seems best, for the present, to
trace each of the northern classes back to its own dialect,
and to account for the more special coincidences between
such languages as, for instance, the Slavonic and Teutonic,
by admitting that the ancestors of these races
preserved from the beginning certain dialectical peculiarities
which existed before, as well as after, the separation
of the Aryan family.

<head>Lecture VI. Comparative Grammar.</head>

<p>
The genealogical classification of the Aryan languages
was founded, as we saw, on a close comparison of
the grammatical characteristics of each; and it is the object
of such works as Bopp's <q>Comparative Grammar</q>
to show that the grammatical articulation of Sanskrit,
Zend, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Teutonic, and Slavonic,
was produced once and for all; and that the apparent
differences in the terminations of Sanskrit, Greek, and
Latin, must be explained by laws of phonetic decay, peculiar
to each dialect, which modified the original common
Aryan type, and changed it into so many national
languages. It might seem, therefore, as if the object
of comparative grammar was attained as soon as the
exact genealogical relationship of languages had been
settled; and those who only look to the higher problems
of the science of language have not hesitated to
declare that <q>there is no painsworthy difficulty nor dispute
about declension, number, case, and gender of
nouns.</q> But although it is certainly true that comparative
grammar is only a means, and that it has well
nigh taught us all that it has to teach,&mdash;at least in the
Aryan family of speech,&mdash;it is to be hoped that, in the
science of language, it will always retain that prominent
place which it has obtained through the labors of Bopp,
<pb n='215'/><anchor id='Pg215'/>
Grimm, Pott, Benfey, Curtius, Kuhn, and others. Besides,
comparative grammar has more to do than simply
to compare. It would be easy enough to place side by
side the paradigms of declension and conjugation in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, and the other Aryan dialects, and
to mark both their coincidences and their differences.
But after we have done this, and after we have explained
the phonetic laws which cause the primitive
Aryan type to assume that national variety which we
admire in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin, new problems
arise of a more interesting nature. We know that
grammatical terminations, as they are now called, were
originally independent words, and had their own purpose
and meaning. Is it possible, after comparative
grammar has established the original forms of the Aryan
terminations, to trace them back to independent words,
and to discover their original purpose and meaning?
You will remember that this was the point from which
we started. We wanted to know why the termination
<emph>d</emph> in <emph>I loved</emph> should change a present into a past act.
We saw that before answering this question we had to
discover the most original form of this termination by
tracing it from English to Gothic, and afterwards, if
necessary, from Gothic to Sanskrit. We now return
to our original question, namely, What is language that
a mere formal change, such as that of <emph>I love</emph> into <emph>I loved</emph>,
should produce so very material a difference?
</p>

<p>
Let us clearly see what we mean if we make a distinction
between the radical and formal elements of a
language; and by formal elements I mean not only the
terminations of declension and conjugation, but all derivative
elements; all, in fact, that is not radical. Our
view on the origin of language must chiefly depend on
<pb n='216'/><anchor id='Pg216'/>
the view which we take of these formal, as opposed to
the radical, elements of speech. Those who consider
that language is a conventional production, base their arguments
principally on these formal elements. The inflections
of words, they maintain, are the best proof
that language was made by mutual agreement. They
look upon them as mere letters or syllables without any
meaning by themselves; and if they were asked why
the mere addition of a <emph>d</emph> changes
<emph>I love</emph> into <emph>I loved</emph>, or
why the addition of the syllable <emph>rai</emph> gave to <emph>j'aime</emph>, I
love, the power of a future, <emph>j'aimerai</emph>, they would answer,
that it was so because, at a very early time in
the history of the world, certain persons, or families,
or clans, agreed that it should be so.
</p>

<p>
This view was opposed by another which represents
language as an organic and almost a living being, and
explains its formal elements as produced by a principle
of growth inherent in its very nature. <q>Languages,</q><note place='foot'>Farrar,
Origin of Languages, p. 35.</note>
it is maintained, <q>are formed by a process, not of crystalline
accretion, but of germinal development. Every
essential part of language existed as completely (although
only implicitly) in the primitive germ, as the
petals of a flower exist in the bud before the mingled
influences of the sun and the air caused it to unfold.</q>
This view was first propounded by Frederick Schlegel,<note place='foot'><q>It
has been common among grammarians to regard those terminational
changes as evolved by some unknown process from the body of the
noun, as the branches of a tree spring from the stem&mdash;or as elements, unmeaning
in themselves, but employed arbitrarily or conventionally to modify
the meanings of words. This latter view is countenanced by Schlegel.
<q>Languages with inflexions,</q> says Schlegel, <q>are organic languages, because
they include a living principle of development and increase, and alone possess,
if I may so express myself, a fruitful and abundant vegetation. The
wonderful mechanism of these languages consists in forming an immense
variety of words, and in marking the connection of ideas expressed by
these words by the help of an inconsiderable number of syllables, <emph>which,
viewed separately, have no signification</emph>, but which determine with precision
the sense of the words to which they are attached. By modifying radical
letters and by adding derivative syllables to the roots, derivative words of
various sorts are formed, and derivatives from those derivatives. Words
are compounded from several roots to express complex ideas. Finally,
substantives, adjectives, and pronouns are declined, with gender, number,
and case; verbs are conjugated throughout voices, moods, tenses, numbers,
and persons, by employing, in like manner, terminations and sometimes
augments, which by themselves signify nothing. This method is attended
with the advantage of enunciating in a single word the principal idea, frequently
greatly modified, and extremely complex already, with its whole array
of accessory ideas and mutable relations.</q></q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Transactions
of the Philological Society</hi>, vol. ii. p. 39.</note>
<pb n='217'/><anchor id='Pg217'/>
and it is still held by many with whom poetical phraseology
takes the place of sound and severe reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The science of language adopts neither of these
views. As to imagining a congress for settling the
proper exponents of such relations as nominative, genitive,
singular, plural, active, and passive, it stands
to reason that if such abstruse problems could have
been discussed in a language void of inflections, there
was no inducement for agreeing on a more perfect
means of communication. And as to imagining language,
that is to say nouns and verbs, endowed with
an inward principle of growth, all we can say is, that
such a conception is really inconceivable. Language
may be conceived as a production, but it cannot be
conceived as a substance that could itself produce.
But the science of language has nothing to do with
mere theories, whether conceivable or not. It collects
facts, and its only object is to account for these facts,
as far as possible. Instead of looking on inflections in
general either as conventional signs or natural excrescences,
it takes each termination by itself, establishes
its most primitive form by means of comparison,
and then treats that primitive syllable as it would treat
<pb n='218'/><anchor id='Pg218'/>
any other part of language,&mdash;namely, as something
which was originally intended to convey a meaning.
Whether we are still able to discover the original intention
of every part of language is quite a different
question, and it should be admitted at once that many
grammatical forms, after they have been restored to
their most primitive type, are still without an explanation.
But with every year new discoveries are made
by means of careful inductive reasoning. We become
more familiar every day with the secret ways of language,
and there is no reason to doubt that in the end
grammatical analysis will be as successful as chemical
analysis. Grammar, though sometimes very bewildering
to us in its later stages, is originally a much less
formidable undertaking than is commonly supposed.
What is grammar after all but declension and conjugation?
Originally declension could not have been anything
but the composition of a noun with some other
word expressive of number and case. How the number
was expressed, we saw in a former lecture; and the
same process led to the formation of cases.
</p>

<p>
Thus the locative is formed in various ways in
Chinese:<note place='foot'> Endlicher, Chinesische Grammatik, p.
172.</note> one is by adding such words as <emph>ćung</emph>, the
middle, or <emph>néi</emph>, inside. Thus, <emph>kûŏ-ćung</emph>, in the empire;
<emph>i sûí ćung</emph>, within a year. The instrumental is formed
by the preposition <emph>ẏ</emph>, which preposition is an old root,
meaning <emph>to use</emph>. Thus <emph>ẏ ting</emph>, with a stick, where in
Latin we should use the ablative, in Greek the dative.
Now, however complicated the declensions, regular and
irregular, may be in Greek and Latin, we may be certain
that originally they were formed by this simple
method of composition.
</p>

<pb n='219'/><anchor id='Pg219'/>

<p>
There was originally in all the Aryan languages a
case expressive of locality, which grammarians call the
<emph>locative</emph>. In Sanskrit every substantive has its locative,
as well as its genitive, dative, and accusative. Thus,
<emph>heart</emph> in Sanskrit is <emph>hṛid</emph>; in the heart, is <emph>hṛidi</emph>.
Here, therefore, the termination of the locative is simply short
<emph>i</emph>. This short <emph>i</emph> is a demonstrative root, and in all probability
the same root which in Latin produced the
preposition <emph>in</emph>. The Sanskrit <emph>hṛidi</emph> represents, therefore,
an original compound, as it were, <emph>heart-within</emph>,
which gradually became settled as one of the recognized
cases of nouns ending in consonants. If we look
to Chinese,<note place='foot'>Endlicher, Chinesische
Grammatik, s. 172.</note> we find that the locative is expressed there
in the same manner, but with a greater freedom in the
choice of the words expressive of locality. <q>In the
empire,</q> is expressed by <emph>kûŏ ćung</emph>; <q>within a year,</q> is
expressed by <emph>ĭ sûí ćung</emph>. Instead of <emph>ćung</emph>, however,
we might have employed other terms also, such as, for
instance, <emph>néi</emph>, inside. It might be said that the formation
of so primitive a case as the locative offers little
difficulty, but that this process of composition fails to
account for the origin of the more abstract cases, the
accusative, the dative, and genitive. If we derive our
notions of the cases from philosophical grammar, it is
true, no doubt, that it would be difficult to convey by
a simple composition the abstract relations supposed to
be expressed by the terminations of the genitive, dative,
and accusative. But remember that these are only
general categories under which philosophers and grammarians
endeavored to arrange the facts of language.
The people with whom language grew up knew nothing
of datives and accusatives. Everything that is abstract
<pb n='220'/><anchor id='Pg220'/>
in language was originally concrete. If people wanted
to say the King of Rome, they meant really the King
at Rome, and they would readily have used what I
have just described as the locative; whereas the more
abstract idea of the genitive would never enter into
their system of thought. But more than this, it can
be proved that the locative has actually taken, in some
cases, the place of the genitive. In Latin, for instance,
the old genitive of nouns in <emph>a</emph> was <emph>as</emph>. This we find
still in <emph>pater familiâs</emph>, instead of <emph>pater familiæ</emph>.
The Umbrian and Oscan dialects retained the <emph>s</emph> throughout
as the sign of the genitive after nouns in <emph>a</emph>. The <emph>æ</emph>
of the genitive was originally <emph>ai</emph>, that is to say, the old
locative in <emph>i</emph>. <q>King of Rome,</q> if rendered by <emph>Rex
Romæ</emph>, meant really <q>King at Rome.</q> And here you
will see how grammar, which ought to be the most
logical of all sciences, is frequently the most illogical.
A boy is taught at school, that if he wants to say <q>I
am staying at Rome,</q> he must use the genitive to express
the locative. How a logician or grammarian can
so twist and turn the meaning of the genitive as to
make it express rest in a place, is not for us to inquire;
but, if he succeeded, his pupil would at once use
the genitive of Carthage (Carthaginis) or of Athens
(Athenarum) for the same purpose, and he would then
have to be told that these genitives could not be used
in the same manner as the genitive of nouns in <emph>a.</emph>
How all this is achieved by what is called philosophical
grammar, we know not; but comparative grammar
at once removes all difficulty. It is only in the first
declension that the locative has supplanted the genitive,
whereas <emph>Carthaginis</emph> and <emph>Athenarum</emph>, being real genitives,
could never be employed to express a locative.
<pb n='221'/><anchor id='Pg221'/>
A special case, such as the locative, may be generalized
into the more general genitive, but not <hi rend='italic'>vice versâ</hi>.
</p>

<p>
You see thus by one instance how what grammarians
call a genitive was formed by the same process
of composition which we can watch in Chinese, and
which we can prove to have taken place in the original
language of the Aryans. And the same applies to the
dative. If a boy is told that the dative expresses a relation
of one object to another, less direct than that of
the accusative, he may well wonder how such a flying
arch could ever have been built up with the scanty
materials which language has at her disposal; but he
will be still more surprised if, after having realized this
grammatical abstraction, he is told that in Greek, in
order to convey the very definite idea of being in a
place, he has to use after certain nouns the termination
of the dative. <q>I am staying at Salamis,</q> must
be expressed by the dative <emph>Salamînĭ</emph>. If you ask why?
Comparative grammar again can alone give an answer.
The termination of the Greek dative in <emph>i</emph>, was originally
the termination of the locative. The locative may well
convey the meaning of the dative, but the faded features
of the dative can never express the fresh distinctness
of the locative. The dative <emph>Salamînĭ</emph> was first a locative.
<q>I live at Salamis,</q> never conveyed the meaning,
<q>I live to Salamis.</q> On the contrary, the dative,
in such phrases as <q>I give it to the father,</q> was originally
a locative; and after expressing at first the palpable
relation of <q>I give it unto the father,</q> or <q>I
place it on or in the father,</q> it gradually assumed the
more general, the less local, less colored aspect which
logicians and grammarians ascribe to their
datives.<note place='foot'><q>The Algonquins have but
one case which may be called locative.</q> Du
Ponceau, p. 158.</note>
</p>

<pb n='222'/><anchor id='Pg222'/>

<p>
If the explanation just given of some of the cases
in Greek and Latin should seem too artificial or too
forced, we have only to think of French in order to see
exactly the same process repeated under our eyes. The
most abstract relations of the genitive, as, for instance,
<q>The immortality of the soul</q> (<emph>l'immortalité de l'âme</emph>);
or of the dative, as, for instance, <q>I trust myself to
God</q> (<emph>je me fie à Dieu</emph>), are expressed by prepositions,
such as <emph>de</emph> and <emph>ad</emph>, which in Latin had the distinct
local meanings of <q>down from,</q> and <q>towards.</q>
Nay, the English <emph>of</emph> and <emph>to</emph>, which have taken the
place of the German terminations <emph>s</emph> and <emph>m</emph>, are likewise
prepositions of an originally local character. The
only difference between our cases and those of the ancient
languages consists in this,&mdash;that the determining
element is now placed before the word, whereas, in the
original language of the Aryans, it was placed at the
end.
</p>

<p>
What applies to the cases of nouns, applies with
equal truth to the terminations of verbs. It may seem
difficult to discover in the personal terminations of
Greek and Latin the exact pronouns which were added
to a verbal base in order to express, <emph>I</emph> love, <emph>thou</emph> lovest,
<emph>he</emph> loves; but it stands to reason that originally these
terminations must have been the same in all languages,&mdash;namely,
personal pronouns. We may be puzzled by the terminations
of <emph>thou lovest</emph> and <emph>he loves</emph>, where <emph>st</emph>
and <emph>s</emph> can hardly be identified with the modern <emph>thou</emph>
and <emph>he</emph>; but we have only to place all the Aryan dialects
together, and we shall see at once that they point
back to an original set of terminations which can easily
be brought to tell their own story.
</p>

<p>
Let us begin with modern formations, because we
have here more daylight for watching the intricate and
<pb n='223'/><anchor id='Pg223'/>
sometimes wayward movements of language; or, better
still, let us begin with an imaginary case, or with what
may be called the language of the future, in order to
see quite clearly how, what we should call grammatical
forms, may arise. Let us suppose that the slaves in
America were to rise against their masters, and, after
gaining some victories, were to sail back in large numbers
to some part of Central Africa, beyond the reach
of their white enemies or friends. Let us suppose these
men availing themselves of the lessons they had learnt
in their captivity, and gradually working out a civilization
of their own. It is quite possible that some centuries
hence, a new Livingstone might find among the
descendants of the American slaves, a language, a literature,
laws, and manners, bearing a striking similitude
to those of his own country. What an interesting
problem for any future historian and ethnologist!
Yet there are problems in the past history of the world
of equal interest, which have been and are still to be
solved by the student of language. Now I believe that
a careful examination of the language of the descendants
of those escaped slaves would suffice to determine
with perfect certainty their past history, even though
no documents and no tradition had preserved the story
of their captivity and liberation. At first, no doubt,
the threads might seem hopelessly entangled. A missionary
might surprise the scholars of Europe by an
account of that new African language. He might describe
it at first as very imperfect&mdash;as a language, for
instance, so poor that the same word had to be used to
express the most heterogeneous ideas. He might point
out how the same sound, without any change of accent,
meant <emph>true</emph>, a <emph>ceremony</emph>, a
<emph>workman</emph>, and was used also
<pb n='224'/><anchor id='Pg224'/>
as a verb in the sense of literary composition. All
these, he might say, are expressed in that strange dialect
by the sound <emph>rait</emph> (right, rite, wright, write). He
might likewise observe that this dialect, as poor almost
as Chinese, had hardly any grammatical inflections,
and that it had no genders, except in a few words such
as man-of-war, and a railway-engine, which were both
conceived as feminine beings, and spoken of as <emph>she</emph>.
He might then mention an even more extraordinary
feature, namely, that although this language had no
terminations for the masculine and feminine genders of
nouns, it employed a masculine and feminine termination
after the affirmative particle, according as it was
addressed to a lady or a gentleman. Their affirmative
particle being the same as the English, <emph>Yes</emph>, they
added a final <emph>r</emph> to it if addressed to a man, and a final
<emph>m</emph> if addressed to a lady: that is to say, instead of
simply saying, <emph>Yes</emph>, these descendants of the escaped
American slaves said <emph>Yesr</emph> to a man, and <emph>Yesm</emph> to a
lady.
</p>

<p>
Absurd as this may sound, I can assure you that
the descriptions which are given of the dialects of savage
tribes, as explained for the first time by travellers
or missionaries, are even more extraordinary. But let
us consider now what the student of language would
have to do, if such forms as <emph>Yeśr</emph> and <emph>Yeśm</emph> were, for
the first time, brought under his notice. He would
first have to trace them back historically, as far as possible
to their more original types, and if he discovered
their connection with <emph>Yes Sir</emph> and <emph>Yes Ma'm</emph>, he would
point out how such contractions were most likely to
spring up in a vulgar dialect. After having traced
back the <emph>Yesr</emph> and <emph>Yesm of</emph> the free African negroes
<pb n='225'/><anchor id='Pg225'/>
to the idiom of their former American masters, the
etymologist would next inquire how such phrases as
<emph>Yes Sir</emph> and <emph>Yes Madam</emph>, came to be used on the
American continent.
</p>

<p>
Finding nothing analogous in the dialects of the aboriginal
inhabitants of America, he would be led, by a
mere comparison of words, to the languages of Europe,
and here again, first to the language of England. Even
if no historical documents had been preserved, the documents
of language would show that the white masters,
whose language the ancestors of the free Africans
adopted during their servitude, came originally from
England, and, within certain limits, it would even be
possible to fix the time when the English language was
first transplanted to America. That language must
have passed, at least, the age of Chaucer before it migrated
to the New World. For Chaucer has two affirmative
particles, <emph>Yea</emph> and <emph>Yes</emph>, and he distinguishes
between the two. He uses <emph>Yes</emph> only in answer to negative
questions. For instance, in answer to <q>Does he
not go?</q> he would say, <emph>Yes</emph>. In all other cases
Chaucer uses <emph>Yea</emph>. To a question, <q>Does he go?</q>
he would answer <emph>Yea</emph>. He observes the same distinction
between <emph>No</emph> and <emph>Nay</emph>, the former being used after
negative, the latter after all other questions. This distinction
became obsolete soon after Sir Thomas More,<note place='foot'>Marsh, p. 579.</note>
and it must have become obsolete before phrases such
as <emph>Yes Sir</emph> and <emph>Yes Madam</emph> could have assumed their
stereotyped character.
</p>

<p>
But there is still more historical information to be
gained from these phrases. The word <emph>Yes</emph> is Anglo-Saxon,
the same as the German <emph>Ja</emph>, and it therefore
<pb n='226'/><anchor id='Pg226'/>
reveals the fact that the white masters of the American
slaves who crossed the Atlantic after the time of Chaucer,
had crossed the Channel at an earlier period after
leaving the continental fatherland of the Angles and
Saxons. The words <emph>Sir</emph> and <emph>Madam</emph> tell us still more.
They are Norman words, and they could only have
been imposed on the Anglo-Saxons of Britain by Norman
conquerors. They tell us more than this. For
these Normans or Northmen spoke originally a Teutonic
dialect, closely allied to Anglo-Saxon, and in that
dialect words such as <emph>Sir</emph> and <emph>Madam</emph> could never have
sprung up. We may conclude therefore that, previous
to the Norman conquest, the Teutonic Northmen must
have made a sufficiently long stay in one of the Roman
provinces to forget their own and adopt the language
of the Roman Provincials.
</p>

<p>
We may now trace back the Norman <emph>Madam</emph> to the
French <emph>Madame</emph>, and we recognize in this a corruption
of the Latin <emph>Mea domina</emph>, my mistress. <emph>Domina</emph> was
changed into <emph>domna</emph>, <emph>donna</emph>, and <emph>dame</emph>, and the same
word <emph>Dame</emph> was also used as a masculine in the sense of lord,
as a corruption of <emph>Domino</emph>, <emph>Domno</emph> and <emph>Donno</emph>. The
temporal lord ruling as ecclesiastical seigneur under the
bishop, was called a <emph>vidame</emph>, as the Vidame of Chartres,
&amp;c. The French interjection <emph>Dame!</emph> has no connection
with a similar exclamation in English, but it simply
means Lord! <emph>Dame-Dieu</emph> in old French is Lord God.
A derivative of <emph>Domina</emph>, mistress, was <emph>dominicella</emph>, which
became <emph>Demoiselle</emph> and <emph>Damsel</emph>. The masculine <emph>Dame</emph>
for <emph>Domino</emph>, Lord, was afterwards replaced by the Latin
<emph>Senior</emph>, a translation of the German <emph>elder</emph>. This word
<emph>elder</emph> was a title of honor, and we have it still both in
<emph>alderman</emph>, and in what is originally the same, the English
<pb n='227'/><anchor id='Pg227'/>
<emph>Earl</emph>, the Norse <emph>Jarl</emph>, a corruption of the A.-S.
<emph>ealdor</emph>. This title <emph>Senior</emph>, meaning
originally <emph>older</emph>, was but rarely<note place='foot'>In
Old Portuguese, Diez mentions <emph>senhor rainha, mia sennor formosa</emph>,
my beautiful mistress.</note> applied to ladies as a title of honor. <emph>Senior</emph>
was changed into <emph>Seigneur</emph>, <emph>Seigneur</emph> into <emph>Sieur</emph>, and
<emph>Sieur</emph> soon dwindled down to <emph>Sir</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Thus we see how in two short phrases, such as <emph>Yesr</emph>
and <emph>Yesm</emph>, long chapters of history might be read. If
a general destruction of books, such as took place in
China under the Emperor Thsin-chi-hoang-ti (213 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>),
should sweep away all historical documents, language,
even in its most depraved state, would preserve the
secrets of the past, and would tell future generations
of the home and migrations of their ancestors from the
East to the West Indies.
</p>

<p>
It may seem startling at first to find the same name,
<emph>the East Indies</emph> and <emph>the West Indies</emph>, at the two extremities
of the Aryan migrations; but these very names
are full of historical meaning. They tell us how the
Teutonic race, the most vigorous and enterprising of
all the members of the Aryan family, gave the name
of <emph>West Indies</emph> to the country which in their world-compassing
migrations they imagined to be India itself;
how they discovered their mistake and then distinguished
between the East Indies and West Indies;
how they planted new states in the west, and regenerated
the effete kingdoms in the east; how they
preached Christianity, and at last practised it by abolishing
slavery of body and mind among the slaves of
West-Indian landholders, and the slaves of Brahmanical
soulholders, till they greeted at last the very homes
from which the Aryan family had started when setting
<pb n='228'/><anchor id='Pg228'/>
out on their discovery of the world. All this, and
even more, may be read in the vast archives of language.
The very name of India has a story to tell,
for India is not a native name. We have it from the
Romans, the Romans from the Greeks, the Greeks from
the Persians. And why from the Persians? Because
it is only in Persian that an initial s is changed into <emph>h</emph>,
which initial <emph>h</emph> was as usual dropped in Greek. It is
only in Persian that the country of the <emph>Sindhu</emph> (<emph>sindhu</emph>
is the Sanskrit name for <emph>river</emph>), or of the <emph>seven sindhus</emph>,
could have been called <emph>Hindia</emph> or <emph>India</emph>
instead of <emph>Sindia</emph>.
Unless the followers of Zoroaster had pronounced
every <emph>s</emph> like <emph>h</emph>, we should never have heard of the West
Indies!
</p>

<p>
We have thus seen by an imaginary instance what
we must be prepared for in the growth of language,
and we shall now better understand why it must be
laid down as a fundamental principle in Comparative
Grammar to look upon nothing in language as
merely formal, till every attempt has been made to
trace the formal elements of language back to their
original and substantial prototypes. We are accustomed
to the idea of grammatical terminations modifying
the meaning of words. But words can be modified
by words only; and though in the present state of
our science it would be too much to say that all grammatical
terminations have been traced back to original
independent words, so many of them have, even in
cases where only a single letter was left, that we may
well lay it down as a rule that all formal elements of
language were originally substantial. Suppose English
had never been written down before the time of Piers
Ploughman. What should we make of such a form as
<pb n='229'/><anchor id='Pg229'/>
<emph>nadistou</emph>,<note place='foot'>Marsh, p. 387. Barnes, Poems in Dorsetshire
Dialect.</note> instead of <emph>ne hadst thou</emph>? <emph>Ne rechi</emph> instead
of <emph>I reck not</emph>? <emph>Al ô'm</emph> in Dorsetshire is <emph>all of
them</emph>. <emph>I midden</emph> is <emph>I may not</emph>; <emph>I cooden</emph>,
<emph>I could not</emph>. Yet the
changes which Sanskrit had undergone before it was
reduced to writing, must have been more considerable
by far than what we see in these dialects.
</p>

<p>
Let us now look to modern classical languages such
as French and Italian. Most of the grammatical terminations
are the same as in Latin, only changed by
phonetic corruption. Thus <emph>j'aime</emph> is <emph>ego amo</emph>, <emph>tu
aimes</emph>, <emph>tu amas</emph>, <emph>il aime</emph>, <emph>ille amat</emph>. There
was originally a final <emph>t</emph> in French <emph>il aime</emph>, and it comes out
again in such phrases as <emph>aime-t-il?</emph> Thus the French
imperfect corresponds to the Latin imperfect, the Parfait
défini to the Latin perfect. But what about the
French future? There is no similarity between <emph>amabo</emph>
and <emph>j'aimerai</emph>. Here then we have a new grammatical
form, sprung up, as it were, within the recollection
of men; or, at least, in the broad daylight of history.
Now, did the termination <emph>rai</emph> bud forth like a blossom
in spring? or did some wise people meet together to
invent this new termination, and pledge themselves to
use it instead of the old termination <emph>bo</emph>? Certainly
not. We see first of all that in all the Romance
languages the terminations of the future are identical
with the auxiliary verb <emph>to have</emph>.<note place='foot'>Survey
of Languages, p. 21.</note> In French
you find&mdash;
</p>

<lg>
<l>j'ai  and je chanter-ai   nous avons   and   nous chanterons.</l>
<l>tu as and tu chanter-as   vous avez    and   vous chanterez.</l>
<l>il a  and il chanter-a    ils ont      and   ils chanteront.</l>
</lg>

<p>
But besides this, we actually find in Spanish and
<pb n='230'/><anchor id='Pg230'/>
Provençal the apparent termination of the future used
as an independent word and not yet joined to the infinitive.
We find in Spanish, instead of <q><emph>lo hare</emph>,</q> I
shall do it, the more primitive form <emph>hacer lo he</emph>;
<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>,
<emph>facere id habeo</emph>. We find in Provençal, <emph>dir vos ai</emph> instead
of <emph>je vous dirai</emph>; <emph>dir vos em</emph> instead of <emph>nous vous
dirons</emph>. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the
Romance future was originally a compound of the auxiliary
verb <emph>to have</emph> with an infinitive; and <emph>I have to say</emph>,
easily took the meaning of <emph>I shall say</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Here, then, we see clearly how grammatical forms
arise. A Frenchman looks upon his futures as merely
grammatical forms. He has no idea, unless he is a
scholar, that the terminations of his futures are identical
with the auxiliary verb <emph>avoir</emph>. The Roman had no
suspicion that <emph>amabo</emph> was a compound; but it can be
proved to contain an auxiliary verb as clearly as the
French future. The Latin future was destroyed by
means of phonetic corruption. When the final letters
lost their distinct pronunciation it became impossible to
keep the imperfect <emph>amabam</emph> separate from the future
<emph>amabo</emph>. The future was then replaced by dialectical regeneration,
for the use of <emph>habeo</emph> with an infinitive is found
in Latin, in such expressions as <emph>habeo dicere</emph>, I have to
say, which would imperceptibly glide into I shall
say.<note place='foot'>Fuchs, Romanische Sprachen, s. 344.</note>
In fact, wherever we look we see that, the future is
expressed by means of composition. We have in English
<emph>I shall</emph> and <emph>thou wilt</emph>, which mean originally <emph>I am
bound</emph> and <emph>thou intendest</emph>. In German we use <emph>werden</emph>,
the Gothic <emph>vairthan</emph>, which means originally to go, to
turn towards. In modern Greek we find thelō, I will,
in thelō dōsei, I shall give. In Roumansch we meet
<pb n='231'/><anchor id='Pg231'/>
with <emph>vegnir</emph>, to come, forming the future <emph>veng a vegnir</emph>,
I shall come; whereas in French <emph>je viens de dire</emph>, I
come from saying, is equivalent to <q>I have just said.</q>
The French <emph>je vais dire</emph> is almost a future, though
originally it is <emph>vado dicere</emph>, I go to say. The Dorsetshire,
<q>I be gwâin to goo a-pickèn stuones,</q> is another
case in point. Nor is there any doubt that in
the Latin <emph>bo</emph> of <emph>amabo</emph> we have the old
auxiliary <emph>bhû</emph>, to
be, and in the Greek future in σω, the old auxiliary <emph>as</emph>,
to be.<note place='foot'>The Greek term for the future is ὁ μέλλων, and μέλλω is used as
an auxiliary verb to form certain futures in Greek. It has various meanings,
but they can all be traced back to the Sanskrit <emph>man</emph> (<emph>manyate</emph>),
to think. As <emph>anya</emph>, other, is changed to ἄλλος, so <emph>manye</emph>,
I think, to μέλλω. Il. ii. 39:
θήσειν ἔτ᾽ ἔμελλεν ἐπ ἀλγέα τε στοναchάς τε Τρωσί τε καὶ Δαναοῖσι, <q>he still
thought to lay sufferings on Trojans and Greeks.</q> Il. xxiii. 544: μέλλεις
ἀφαιρήσεσθαι ἄεθλον, <q>thou thinkest thou wouldst have stripped me of the
prize.</q> Od. xiii. 293: οὐκ ἄρ᾽ ἔμελλες λήξειν; <q>did you
not think of stopping?</q> <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> were
you not going to stop? Or again in such phrases as Il.
ii. 36, τὰ οὐ τελέσεσθαι ἔμελλον, <q>these things were not meant to be accomplished,</q>
literally, these things did not mean to be accomplished. Thus
μέλλω was used of things that were likely to be, as if these things themselves
meant or intended to be or not to be; and, the original meaning
being forgotten, μέλλω came to be a mere auxiliary expressing probability.
Μέλλω and μέλλομαι, in the sense of <q>to hesitate,</q> are equally explained
by the Sanskrit <emph>man</emph>, to think or consider. In Old Norse the future is
likewise formed by <emph>mun</emph>, to mean.</note>
</p>

<p>
We now go back another step, and ask the question
which we asked many times before, How can a mere <emph>d</emph>
produce so momentous a change as that from <emph>I love</emph> to
<emph>I loved</emph>? As we have learnt in the meantime that
English goes back to Anglo-Saxon, and is closely related
to continental Saxon and Gothic, we look at once
to the Gothic imperfect in order to see whether it has
preserved any traces of the original compound; for,
after what we have seen in the previous cases, we
are no doubt prepared to find here, too, grammatical
terminations mere remnants of independent words.
</p>

<p>
In Gothic there is a verb <emph>nasjan</emph>, to nourish. Its
preterite is as follows:&mdash;

<p>
If we had only the Anglo-Saxon preterite <emph>nerëde</emph> and the
Anglo-Saxon <emph>dide</emph>, the identity of the <emph>de</emph> in <emph>nerëde</emph>
with <emph>dide</emph> would not be very apparent. But here you
will perceive the advantage which Gothic has over all
other Teutonic dialects for the purposes of grammatical
comparison and analysis. It is in Gothic, and in Gothic
in the plural only, that the full auxiliary <emph>dêdum</emph>, <emph>dêduþ</emph>,
<emph>dêdun</emph> has been preserved. In the Gothic singular
<emph>nasida</emph>, <emph>nasidês</emph>, <emph>nasida</emph> stand
for <emph>nasideda</emph>, <emph>nasidedês</emph>,
<pb n='233'/><anchor id='Pg233'/>
<emph>nasideda</emph>. The same contraction has taken place in
Anglo-Saxon, not only in the singular but in the plural
also. Yet, such is the similarity between Gothic and
Anglo-Saxon that we cannot doubt their preterites
having been formed on the same last. If there be
any truth in inductive reasoning, there must have been
an original Anglo-Saxon preterite,<note place='foot'>Bopp, Comp.
Grammar, § 620. Grimm, German Grammar, ii. 845.</note>

<p>
And as <emph>ner-ë-dide</emph> dwindled down to <emph>nerëde</emph>,
so <emph>nerëde</emph>
would, in modern English, become <emph>nered</emph>. The <emph>d</emph> of
the preterite, therefore, which changes <emph>I love</emph> into <emph>I
loved</emph> is originally the auxiliary verb <emph>to do</emph>, and <emph>I loved</emph>
is the same as <emph>I love did</emph>, or <emph>I did love</emph>. In English
dialects, as, for instance, in the Dorset dialect, every
preterite, if it expresses a lasting or repeated action, is
formed by <emph>I did</emph>,<note place='foot'>Barnes,
Dorsetshire Dialect, p. 39.</note> and a distinction is thus established
between <q>'e died eesterdae,</q> and <q>the vo'ke did die by
scores;</q> though originally <emph>died</emph> is the same as <emph>die did</emph>.
</p>

<p>
It might be asked, however, very properly, how <emph>did</emph>
itself, or the Anglo-Saxon <emph>dide</emph>, was formed, and how it
received the meaning of a preterite. In <emph>dide</emph> the final
<emph>de</emph> is not termination, but it is the root, and the first
syllable <emph>di</emph> is a reduplication of the root, the fact being
that all preterites of old, or, as they are called, strong
verbs, were formed as in Greek and Sanskrit by means
of reduplication, reduplication being one of the principal
means by which roots were invested with a verbal
character.<note place='foot'>See M. M.'s Letter on the Turanian
Languages, pp. 44, 46.</note> The root <emph>do</emph> in Anglo-Saxon is the same
<pb n='234'/><anchor id='Pg234'/>
as the root <emph>thē</emph> in <emph>tithēmi</emph> in Greek, and the Sanskrit
root <emph>dhâ</emph> in <emph>dadâdmi</emph>. Anglo-Saxon <emph>dide</emph> would
therefore correspond to Sanskrit <emph>dadhau</emph>, I placed.
</p>

<p>
Now, in this manner, the whole, or nearly the whole,
grammatical framework of the Aryan or Indo-European
languages has been traced back to original independent
words, and even the slightest changes which at first
sight seem so mysterious, such as <emph>foot</emph> into <emph>feet</emph>, or <emph>I
find</emph> into <emph>I found</emph>, have been fully accounted for. This
is what is called comparative grammar, or a scientific
analysis of all the formal elements of a language preceded
by a comparison of all the varieties which one and
the same form has assumed in the numerous dialects of
the Aryan family. The most important dialects for
this purpose are Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Gothic;
but in many cases Zend, or Celtic, or Slavonic dialects
come in to throw an unexpected light on forms unintelligible
in any of the four principal dialects. The result
of such a work as Bopp's <q>Comparative Grammar</q>
of the Aryan languages may be summed up in a few
words. The whole framework of grammar&mdash;the elements
of derivation, declension, and conjugation&mdash;had
become settled before the separation of the Aryan
family. Hence the broad outlines of grammar, in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, Gothic, and the rest, are in reality
the same; and the apparent differences can be explained
by phonetic corruption, which is determined by the
phonetic peculiarities of each nation. On the whole,
the history of all the Aryan languages is nothing but a
gradual process of decay. After the grammatical terminations
of all these languages have been traced back
to their most primitive form, it is possible, in many instances,
to determine their original meaning. This,
<pb n='235'/><anchor id='Pg235'/>
however, can be done by means of induction only; and
the period during which, as in the Provençal <emph>dir vos ai</emph>,
the component elements of the old Aryan grammar
maintained a separate existence in the language and
the mind of the Aryans had closed, before Sanskrit was
Sanskrit or Greek Greek. That there was such a
period we can doubt as little as we can doubt the real
existence of fern forests previous to the formation of
our coal fields. We can do even more. Suppose we
had no remnants of Latin; suppose the very existence
of Rome and of Latin were unknown to us; we might
still prove, on the evidence of the six Romance dialects,
that there must have been a time when these dialects
formed the language of a small settlement; nay, by
collecting the words which all these dialects share in
common, we might, to a certain extent, reconstruct the
original language, and draw a sketch of the state of
civilization, as reflected by these common words. The
same can be done if we compare Sanskrit, Greek, Latin,
Gothic, Celtic, and Slavonic. The words which have
as nearly as possible the same form and meaning in all
the languages must have existed before the people, who
afterwards formed the prominent nationalities of the
Aryan family, separated; and, if carefully interpreted,
they, too, will serve as evidence as to the state of civilization
attained by the Aryans before they left their
common home. It can be proved, by the evidence of
language, that before their separation the Aryans led
the life of agricultural nomads,&mdash;a life such as Tacitus
describes that of the ancient Germans. They knew the
arts of ploughing, of making roads, of building ships, of
weaving and sewing, of erecting houses; they had
counted at least as far as one hundred. They had domesticated
<pb n='236'/><anchor id='Pg236'/>
the most important animals, the cow, the
horse, the sheep, the dog; they were acquainted with
the most useful metals, and armed with iron hatchets,
whether for peaceful or warlike purposes. They had
recognized the bonds of blood and the bonds of marriage;
they followed their leaders and kings, and the
distinction between right and wrong was fixed by laws
and customs. They were impressed with the idea of
a divine Being, and they invoked it by various names.
All this, as I said, can be proved by the evidence of
language. For if you find that languages like Greek,
Latin, Gothic, Celtic, or Slavonic, which, after their
first separation, have had but little contact with Sanskrit,
have the same word, for instance, for <emph>iron</emph> which
exists in Sanskrit, this is proof absolute that iron was
known previous to the Aryan separation. Now, <emph>iron</emph>
is <emph>ais</emph> in Gothic, and <emph>ayas</emph> in Sanskrit, a word which, as
it could not have been borrowed by the Indians from
the Germans or by the Germans from the Indians,
must have existed previous to their separation. We
could not find the same name for house in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, Slavonic, and Celtic,<note place='foot'>Sk. <emph>dama</emph>; Gr. δόμος;
L. <emph>domus</emph>; Slav. <emph>domü</emph>; Celt. <emph>daimh</emph>.</note>
unless houses had
been known before the separation of these dialects. In
this manner a history of Aryan civilization has been
written from the archives of language, stretching back
to times far beyond the reach of any documentary
history.<note place='foot'>See M. M.'s Essay on Comparative
Mythology, Oxford Essays, 1856.</note>
</p>

<p>
The very name of <emph>Arya</emph> belongs to this history, and
I shall devote the rest of this lecture to tracing the
origin and gradual spreading of this old word. I had
intended to include, in to-day's lecture, a short account
<pb n='237'/><anchor id='Pg237'/>
of <emph>comparative mythology</emph>, a branch of our science which
restores the original form and meaning of decayed words
by the same means by which comparative grammar recovers
the original form and meaning of terminations.
But my time is too limited; and, as I have been asked
repeatedly why I applied the name of <emph>Aryan</emph> to that
family of language which we have just examined, I feel
that I am bound to give an answer.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Ârya</emph> is a Sanskrit word, and in the later Sanskrit it
means <emph>noble</emph>, <emph>of a good family</emph>. It was, however, originally
a national name, and we see traces of it as late as
the Law-book of the Mânavas, where India is still
called <emph>Ârya-âvarta</emph>, the abode of the
<emph>Âryas</emph>.<note place='foot'>Ârya-bhûmi, and Ârya-deśa are
used in the same sense.</note> In the
old Sanskrit, in the hymns of the Veda, <emph>ârya</emph> occurs
frequently as a national name and as a name of honor,
comprising the worshippers of the gods of the Brahmans,
as opposed to their enemies, who are called in
the Veda <emph>Dasyus</emph>. Thus one of the gods, <emph>Indra</emph>, who,
in some respects, answers to the Greek Zeus, is invoked
in the following words (Rigveda, i. 57, 8): <q>Know thou
the Âryas, O Indra, and they who are Dasyus; punish
the lawless, and deliver them unto thy servant! Be
thou the mighty helper of the worshippers, and I will
praise all these thy deeds at the festivals.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the later dogmatic literature of the Vedic age,
the name of Ârya is distinctly appropriated to the
three first castes&mdash;the Brahmans, Kshatriyas, Vaiśyas&mdash;as
opposed to the fourth, or the Śûdras. In the
Śatapatha-Brâhmaņa it is laid down distinctly: <q>Âryas
are only the Brahmans, the Kshatriyas, and Vaiśyas,
for they are admitted to the sacrifices. They shall not
speak with everybody, but only with the Brahman, the
<pb n='238'/><anchor id='Pg238'/>
Kshatriya, and the Vaiśya. If they should fall into a
conversation with a Śûdra, let them say to another
man, <q>Tell this Śûdra so.</q> This is the law.</q>
</p>

<p>
In the Atharva-veda (iv. 20, 4; xix. 62, 1) expressions
occur such as, <q>seeing all things, whether Śûdra
or Ârya,</q> where Śûdra and Ârya are meant to express
the whole of mankind.
</p>

<p>
This word <emph>ârya</emph> with a long <emph>â</emph> is derived from <emph>arya</emph>
with a short <emph>a</emph>, and this name <emph>arya</emph> is applied in the
later Sanskrit to a Vaiśya, or a member of the third
caste.<note place='foot'>Pân. iii. 1, 103.</note>
What is called the third class must originally
have constituted the large majority of the Brahmanic
society, for all who were not soldiers or priests, were
Vaiśyas. We may well understand, therefore, how a
name, originally applied to the cultivators of the soil
and householders, should in time have become a general
name for all Aryans.<note place='foot'>In one of the Vedas,
<emph>arya</emph> with a short <emph>a</emph> is used like <emph>ârya</emph>, as opposed
to Śûdra. For we read (Vâj-San. xx. 17): <q>Whatever sin we have committed
in the village, in the forest, in the home, in the open air, against a
Śûdra, against an Arya,&mdash;thou art our deliverance.</q></note> Why the householders
were called <emph>arya</emph> is a question which would carry us
too far at present. I can only state that the etymological
signification of Arya seems to be <q>one who ploughs
or tills,</q> and that it is connected with the root of <emph>arare</emph>.
The Aryans would seem to have chosen this name for
themselves as opposed to the nomadic races, <emph>the Turanians</emph>,
whose original name <emph>Tura</emph> implies the swiftness
of the horseman.
</p>

<p>
In India, as we saw, the name of Ârya, as a national
name, fell into oblivion in later times, and was
preserved only in the term Âryâvarta, the abode of
the Aryans. But it was more faithfully preserved
<pb n='239'/><anchor id='Pg239'/>
by the Zoroastrians who migrated from India to the
north-west, and whose religion has been preserved to
us in the Zend-avesta, though in fragments only. Now
<emph>Airya</emph> in Zend means venerable, and is at the same
time the name of the people.<note place='foot'>Lassen, Ind.
Alt. b. i. s. 6.</note> In the first chapter of

tainted in turn by Angro mainyus or Ahriman. Now
the first of these countries is called <emph>Airyanem vaêjô</emph>,
<emph>Arianum semen</emph>, the Aryan seed, and its position must
have been as far east as the western slopes of the Belurtag
and Mustag, near the sources of the Oxus and

Asia.<note place='foot'>Ibid. b. i. s. 526.</note> From

horizon of the Zoroastrian world. It would be what

<q>the whole space of Aria,</q> <emph>vîśpem airyô-śayanem</emph> (totum
Ariæ situm).<note place='foot'>Burnouf, Yaśna, notes, 61. In the same sense the

Greek geographers use the name of Ariana
in a wider sense even than the Zend-avesta. All the
country between the Indian Ocean in the south and
the Indus in the east, the Hindu-kush and Paropamisus
in the north, the Caspian gates, Karamania, and

<p>
That <emph>Aryan</emph> was used as a title of honor in the Persian
empire is clearly shown by the cuneiform inscriptions
of Darius. He calls himself <emph>Ariya</emph> and <emph>Ariya-chitra</emph>,
an Aryan and of Aryan descent; and Ahuramazda,
or, as he is called by Darius, Auramazda, is
rendered in the Turanian translation of the inscription
of Behistun, <q>the god of the Aryans.</q> Many historical
names of the Persians contain the same element.
The great-grandfather of Darius is called in the inscriptions
Ariyârâmna, the Greek <emph>Ariaramnēs</emph> (Herod, vii.
90). Ariobarzanēs (<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> Euergetēs),

<p>
Along the Caspian, and in the country washed by
the Oxus and Yaxartes, Aryan and non-Aryan tribes
were mingled together for centuries. Though the relation
between Aryans and Turanians is hostile, and
though there were continual wars between them, as we
learn from the great Persian epic, the Shahnámeh, it
does not follow that all the nomad races who infested
the settlements of the Aryans, were of Tatar blood
and speech. Turvaśa and his descendants, who represent
the Turanians, are described in the later epic
poems of India as cursed and deprived of their inheritance
in India. But in the Vedas Turvaśa is represented
as worshipping Aryan gods. Even in the Shahnámeh,
Persian heroes go over to the Turanians and
lead them against Iran, very much as Coriolanus led
the Samnites against Rome. We may thus understand
why so many Turanian or Scythian names, mentioned
by Greek writers, should show evident traces of Aryan
origin. <emph>Aspa</emph> was the Persian name for <emph>horse</emph>, and in
the Scythian names <emph>Aspabota</emph>, <emph>Aspakara</emph>,
and <emph>Asparatha</emph>,<note place='foot'>Burnouf, Notes, p. 105.</note>
we can hardly fail to recognize the same element.
Even the name of the Aspasian mountains, placed by
Ptolemy in Scythia, indicates a similar origin. Nor is
the word Arya unknown beyond the Oxus. There is
a people called <emph>Ariacœ</emph>,<note place='foot'>Ptol.
vi. 2, and vi. 14. There are Ἀναριάκαι on the frontiers of Hyrcania.
Strabo, xi. 7; Pliny, Hist. Nat. vi. 19.</note> another called
<emph>Antariani</emph>.<note place='foot'>On Arimaspi and
Aramæi, see Burnouf, Notes, p. 105; Plin. vi. 9.</note> A
<pb n='244'/><anchor id='Pg244'/>
king of the Scythians, at the time of Darius, was called
<emph>Ariantes</emph>. A cotemporary of Xerxes is known by the
name of <emph>Aripithes</emph> (<hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi>
Sanskrit, <emph>aryapati</emph>; Zend, <emph>airyapaiti</emph>);
and <emph>Spargapithes</emph> seems to have some connection
with the Sanskrit <emph>svargapati</emph>, lord of heaven.
</p>

<p>
We have thus traced the name of <emph>Ârya</emph> from India
to the west, from Âryâvarta to Ariana, Persia, Media,
more doubtfully to Armenia and Albania, to the Iron
in the Caucasus, and to some of the nomad tribes in
Transoxiana. As we approach Europe the traces of
this name grow fainter, yet they are not altogether
lost.

<p>
Two roads were open to the Aryans of Asia in their
westward migrations. One through Chorasan<note place='foot'><emph>Qairizam</emph>
in the Zend-avesta, <emph>Uvârazmis</emph> in the inscriptions of Darius.</note> to the
north, through what is now called Russia, and thence
to the shores of the Black Sea and Thrace. Another
from Armenia, across the Caucasus or across the Black
Sea to Northern Greece, and along the Danube to
Germany. Now on the former road the Aryans left a
trace of their migration in the old name of Thrace
which was <emph>Aria</emph>;<note place='foot'>Stephanus
Byzantinus.</note> on the latter we meet in the eastern
part of Germany, near the Vistula, with a German
tribe called <emph>Arii</emph>. And as in Persia we found many
proper names in which <emph>Arya</emph> formed an important ingredient,
so we find again in German history names
such as <emph>Ariovistus</emph>.<note place='foot'>Grimm, Rechts
alterthümer, p. 292, traces Arii and Ariovistus back to
the Gothic <emph>harji</emph>, army. If this is right, this part of our argument must be
given up.</note>
</p>

<p>
Though we look in vain for any traces of this old
national name among the Greeks and Romans, late
researches have rendered it at least plausible that it has
<pb n='245'/><anchor id='Pg245'/>
been preserved in the extreme west of the Aryan migrations,
in the very name of <emph>Ireland</emph>. The common
etymology of <emph>Erin</emph> is that it means <q>island of the west,</q>
<emph>iar-innis</emph>, or land of the west, <emph>iar-in</emph>. But this is clearly
wrong.<note place='foot'>Pictet, Les Origines Indo-Européennes, p. 31.
<q><emph>Iar</emph>, l'ouest, ne s'écrit jamais <emph>er</emph> ou <emph>eir</emph>,
et la forme <emph>Iarin</emph> ne se rencontre nulle part pour Erin.</q>
Zeuss gives <emph>iar-rend</emph>, insula occidentalis. But <emph>rend</emph>
(recte <emph>rind</emph>) makes <emph>rendo</emph> in the gen. sing.</note>
The old name is <emph>Ériu</emph> in the nominative, more
recently <emph>Éire</emph>. It is only in the oblique cases that the
final <emph>n</emph> appears, as in <emph>regio</emph>,
<emph>regionis</emph>. <emph>Erin</emph> therefore
has been explained as a derivative of <emph>Er</emph> or <emph>Eri</emph>, said
to be the ancient name of the Irish Celts as preserved
in the Anglo-Saxon name of their country,
<emph>Íraland</emph>.<note place='foot'>Old Norse <emph>írar</emph>,
Irishmen, Anglo-Saxon <emph>ira</emph>, Irishman.</note>
It is maintained by O'Reilly, though denied by others,
that <emph>er</emph> is used in Irish in the sense of noble, like the
Sanskrit <emph>ârya</emph>.<note place='foot'><p>Though
I state these views on the authority of M. Pictet, I think it
right to add the following note which an eminent Irish scholar has had the
kindness to send me:&mdash;<q rend='pre'>The ordinary name of Ireland, in the oldest Irish
MSS., is (<emph>h</emph>)<emph>ériu</emph>, gen. (<emph>h</emph>)<emph>érenn</emph>,
dat. (<emph>h</emph>)<emph>érinn</emph>. The initial <emph>h</emph>, is often omitted.
Before etymologizing on the word, we must try to fix its Old Celtic form.
Of the ancient names of Ireland which are found in Greek and Latin
writers, the only one which <emph>hériu</emph> can
formally represent is <emph>Hiberio</emph>. The
abl. sing. of this form&mdash;<emph>Hiberione</emph>&mdash;is
found in the Book of Armagh, a
Latin MS. of the early part of the ninth century. From the same MS. we
also learn that a name of the Irish people was <emph>Hyberionaces</emph>, which is
obviously a derivative from the stem of <emph>Hiberio</emph>. Now if we remember that
the Old Irish scribes often prefixed <emph>h</emph>
to words beginning with a vowel (<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>
<emph>h-abunde</emph>, <emph>h-arundo</emph>, <emph>h-erimus</emph>,
<emph>h-ostium</emph>), and that they also often wrote <emph>b</emph> for
the <emph>v</emph> consonant (<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi> <emph>bobes</emph>,
<emph>fribulas</emph>, <emph>corbus</emph>, <emph>fabonius</emph>); if, moreover, we
observe that the Welsh and Breton names for Ireland&mdash;<emph>Ywerddon</emph>,
<emph>Iverdon</emph>&mdash;point to an Old Celtic name beginning with
<emph>iver</emph>&mdash;, we shall have little difficulty in giving
<emph>Hiberio</emph> a correctly latinized form, viz. <emph>Iverio</emph>. This
in Old Celtic would be <emph>Iveriu</emph>, gen. <emph>Iverionos</emph>. So the
Old Celtic form of <emph>Fronto</emph> was <emph>Frontû</emph>, as we see from the
Gaulish inscription at Vieux Poitiers. As <emph>v</emph> when flanked by vowels is
always lost in Irish, <emph>Iveriû</emph> would
become <emph>ieriu</emph>, and then, the first two vowels
running together, <emph>ériu</emph>. As
regards the double <emph>n</emph> in the oblique cases of
<emph>ériu</emph>, the genitive <emph>érenn</emph> (<hi rend='italic'>e.g.</hi>)
is to <emph>Iverionos</emph> as the Old Irish <emph>anmann</emph>
<q>names</q> is to the Skr. <emph>nâmâni</emph>, Lat.
<emph>nomina</emph>. The doubling of the <emph>n</emph> may perhaps be due to the Old
Celtic accent. What then is the etymology of <emph>Iveriû</emph>? I venture to think that
it may (like the Lat. <emph>Aver-nus</emph>, Gr. Ἄφορ-νος) be connected with the Skr.
<emph>avara</emph>, <q>posterior,</q> <q>western.</q>
So the Irish <emph>des</emph>, Welsh <emph>deheu</emph>, <q>right,</q>
<q>south,</q> is the Skr. <emph>dakshina</emph>, <q>dexter,</q> and the
Irish <emph>áir</emph> (in <emph>an-áir</emph>), if it
stand for <emph>páir</emph>, <q>east,</q> is the Skr. <emph>pûrva</emph>,
<q>anterior.</q></q>
</p>
<p>
<q>M. Pictet regards Ptolemy's Ἰουερνια (Ivernia) as coming nearest to the
Old Celtic form of the name in question. He further sees in the first syllable
what he calls the Irish <emph>ibh</emph>, <q>land,</q> <q>tribe of people,</q>
and he thinks that this <emph>ibh</emph> may be
connected not only with the Vedic <emph>ibha</emph>, <q>family,</q> but with the
Old High German <emph>eiba</emph>, <q>a district.</q> But, first, according to the Irish
phonetic laws, <emph>ibha</emph> would have appeared as <emph>eb</emph> in Old,
<emph>eabh</emph> in Modern-Irish. Secondly, the <emph>ei</emph> in <emph>eiba</emph> is
a diphthong = Gothic <emph>ái</emph>, Irish <emph>ói</emph>, <emph>óe</emph>, Skr.
<emph>ê</emph>. Consequently <emph>ibh</emph> and <emph>ibha</emph> cannot be identified
with <emph>eiba</emph>. Thirdly, there is no
such word as <emph>ibh</emph> in the nom. sing., although it is to be found in O'Reilly's
dictionary, along with his explanation of the intensive prefix <emph>er</emph>&mdash;, as
<q>noble,</q> and many other blunders and forgeries. The form <emph>ibh</emph> is, no
doubt, producible, but it is a very modern dative plural of <emph>úa</emph>, <q>a
descendant.</q> Irish districts were often called by the names of the occupying clans.
These clans were often called <q>descendants (<emph>huí</emph>, <emph>hí</emph>,
<emph>í</emph>) of such an one.</q>
Hence the blunder of the Irish lexicographer.</q>&mdash;W. S.</p></note>

<p>
Some of the evidence here collected in tracing the
ancient name of the Aryan family, may seem doubtful,
and I have pointed out myself some links of the chain
uniting the earliest name of India with the modern
name of Ireland, as weaker than the rest. But the
principal links are safe. Names of countries, peoples,
rivers, and mountains, have an extraordinary vitality,
and they will remain while cities, kingdoms, and nations
pass away. <emph>Rome</emph> has the same name to-day, and
will probably have it forever, which was given to it by
the earliest Latin and Sabine settlers, and wherever we
find the name of Rome, whether in Wallachia, which
by the inhabitants is called Rumania, or in the dialects
of the Grisons, the Romansch, or in the title of the
Romance languages, we know that some threads would
lead us back to the Rome of Romulus and Remus, the
stronghold of the earliest warriors of Latium. The
ruined city near the mouth of the Upper Zab, now
<pb n='247'/><anchor id='Pg247'/>
usually known by the name of Nimrud, is called <emph>Athur</emph>
by the Arabic geographers, and in Athur we recognize
the old name of Assyria, which Dio Cassius writes Atyria,
remarking that the barbarians changed the Sigma
into Tau. Assyria is called Athurâ, in the inscriptions
of Darius.<note place='foot'>See Rawlinson's Glossary,
s. v.</note> We hear of battles fought on the <emph>Sutledge</emph>,
and we hardly think that the battle field of the Sikhs
was nearly the same where Alexander fought the kings
of the Penjáb. But the name of the <emph>Sutledge</emph> is the
name of the same river as the <emph>Hesudrus</emph> of Alexander,
the <emph>Śatadru</emph> of the Indians, and among the oldest
hymns of the Veda, about 1500 <hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>, we find a war-song
referring to a battle fought on the two banks of
the same river.
</p>

<p>
No doubt there is danger in trusting to mere similarity
of names. Grimm may be right that the Arii of
Tacitus were originally Harii, and that their name is
not connected with Ârya. But the evidence on either
side being merely conjectural, this must remain an open
question. In most cases, however, a strict observation
of the phonetic laws peculiar to each language will remove
all uncertainty. Grimm, in his <q>History of the
German Language</q> (p. 228), imagined that <emph>Hariva</emph>,
the name of <emph>Herat</emph> in the cuneiform inscriptions, is connected
with Arii, the name which, as we saw, Herodotus
gives to the Medes. This cannot be, for the initial
aspiration in <emph>Hariva</emph> points to a word which in Sanskrit
begins with <emph>s</emph>, and not with a vowel, like <emph>ârya</emph>. The
following remarks will make this clearer.
</p>

<p>
Herat is called <emph>Herat</emph> and <emph>Heri</emph>,<note place='foot'>W.
Ouseley, Orient. Geog. of Ebn. Haukal. Burnouf, Yasna, Notes, p.
102.</note> and the river on
<pb n='248'/><anchor id='Pg248'/>
which it stands is called <emph>Heri-rud</emph>. This river <emph>Heri</emph>
is called by Ptolemy Ἀρείας,<note place='foot'>Ptol. vi.
c. 17.</note> by other writers <emph>Arius</emph>;
and <emph>Aria</emph> is the name given to the country between
Parthia (Parthuwa) in the west, Margiana (Marghush)
in the north, Bactria (Bakhtrish) and Arachosia
(Harauwatish) in the east, and Drangiana (Zaraka)
in the south. This, however, though without the
initial <emph>h</emph>, is not Ariana, as described by Strabo, but an
independent country, forming part of it. It is supposed
to be the same as the <emph>Haraiva</emph> (Hariva) of the
cuneiform inscriptions, though this is doubtful. But it
is mentioned in the Zend-avesta, under the name of
<emph>Harôyu</emph>,<note place='foot'>It has been supposed
that <emph>harôyûm</emph> in the Zend-avesta stands for <emph>haraêvem</emph>,
and that the nominative was not <emph>Harôyu</emph>, but <emph>Haraêvô</emph>.
(Oppert, Journal
Asiatique, 1851, p. 280.) Without denying the possibility of the correctness
of this view, which is partially supported by the accusative <emph>vidôyum</emph>,
from <emph>vidaêvo</emph>, enemy of the Divs, there
is no reason why <emph>Harôyûm</emph> should
not be taken for a regular accusative of <emph>Harôyu</emph>.
This <emph>Harôyu</emph> would be as
natural and regular a form as <emph>Sarayu</emph> in Sanskrit, nay even more regular,
as <emph>harôyu</emph> would presuppose a Sanskrit
<emph>sarasyu</emph> or <emph>saroyu</emph>, from <emph>saras</emph>. M.
Oppert identifies the people of <emph>Haraiva</emph> with the Ἀρεῖοι, but not, like
Grimm, with the Ἄριοι.</note> as the sixth country created by Ormuzd. We
can trace this name with the initial <emph>h</emph> even beyond the
time of Zoroaster. The Zoroastrians were a colony
from northern India. They had been together for a
time with the people whose sacred songs have been
preserved to us in the Veda. A schism took place,
and the Zoroastrians migrated westward to Arachosia
and Persia. In their migrations they did what the
Greeks did when they founded new colonies, what
the Americans did in founding new cities. They
gave to the new cities and to the rivers along which
they settled, the names of cities and rivers familiar to
<pb n='249'/><anchor id='Pg249'/>
them, and reminding them of the localities which they
had left. Now, as a Persian <emph>h</emph> points to a Sanskrit <emph>s</emph>,
<emph>Harôyu</emph> would be in Sanskrit <emph>Saroyu</emph>. One of the sacred
rivers of India, a river mentioned in the Veda, and
famous in the epic poems as the river of Ayodhyâ, one
of the earliest capitals of India, the modern Oude, has
the name of <emph>Sarayu</emph>, the modern
<emph>Sardju</emph>.<note place='foot'>It is derived from a root
<emph>sar</emph> or <emph>sṛi</emph>, to go, to run, from which <emph>saras</emph>, water,
<emph>sarit</emph>, river, and <emph>Sarayu</emph>, the proper
name of the river near Oude; and we
may conclude with great probability that this Sarayu or Sarasyu gave the
name to the river Arius or Heri, and to the county of Ἄρια or Herat. Anyhow
Ἄρια, as the name of Herat, has no connection with Ἄρια the wide
country of the Âryas.</note>
</p>

<p>
As Comparative Philology has thus traced the ancient
name of Ârya from India to Europe, as the original
title assumed by the Aryans before they left their common
home, it is but natural that it should have been
chosen as the technical term for the family of languages
which was formerly designated as Indo-Germanic,
Indo-European, Caucasian, or Japhetic.

<head>Lecture VII. The Constituent Elements Of Language.</head>

<p>
Our analysis of some of the nominal and verbal
formations in the Aryan or Indo-European family of
speech has taught us that, however mysterious and
complicated these grammatical forms appear at first
sight, they are in reality the result of a very simple
process. It seems at first almost hopeless to ask such
questions as why the addition of a mere <emph>d</emph> should
change love present into love past, or why the termination
<emph>ai</emph> in French, if added to <emph>aimer</emph>, should convey
the idea of love to come. But, once placed under
the microscope of comparative grammar, these and all
other grammatical forms assume a very different and
much more intelligible aspect. We saw how what
we now call terminations were originally independent
words. After coalescing with the words which they
were intended to modify, they were gradually reduced
to mere syllables and letters, unmeaning in themselves,
yet manifesting their former power and independence
by the modification which they continue to produce in
the meaning of the words to which they are appended.
The true nature of grammatical terminations was first
pointed out by a philosopher, who, however wild some
of his speculations may be, had certainly caught many
a glimpse of the real life and growth of language, I
<pb n='251'/><anchor id='Pg251'/>
mean <emph>Horne Tooke</emph>. This is what he writes
of terminations:<note place='foot'>Diversions of Purley, p. 190.</note>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>For though I think I have good reasons to believe
that all terminations may likewise be traced to their
respective origin; and that, however artificial they
may now appear to us, they were not originally the
effect of premeditated and deliberate <emph>art</emph>, but separate
words by length of time corrupted and coalescing with
the words of which they are now considered as the
terminations. Yet this was less likely to be suspected
by others. And if it had been suspected, they would
have had much further to travel to their journey's end,
and through a road much more embarrassed; as the
corruption in those languages is of much longer standing
than in ours, and more complex.</q>
</p>

<p>
Horne Tooke, however, though he saw rightly what
road should be followed to track the origin of grammatical
terminations, was himself without the means to
reach his journey's end. Most of his explanations
are quite untenable, and it is curious to observe in
reading his book, the Diversions of Purley, how a man
of a clear, sharp, and powerful mind, and reasoning
according to sound and correct principles, may yet,
owing to his defective knowledge of facts, arrive at
conclusions directly opposed to truth.
</p>

<p>
When we have once seen how grammatical terminations
are to be traced back in the beginning to independent
words, we have learnt at the same time that
the component elements of language, which remain in
our crucible at the end of a complete grammatical
analysis, are of two kinds, namely, <emph>Roots predicative</emph>
and <emph>Roots demonstrative</emph>.
</p>

<pb n='252'/><anchor id='Pg252'/>

<p>
We call <emph>root</emph> or <emph>radical</emph>, whatever, in the words of
any language or family of languages, cannot be reduced
to a simpler or more original form. It may be well to
illustrate this by a few examples. But, instead of taking
a number of words in Sanskrit, Greek, and Latin,
and tracing them back to their common centre, it will
be more instructive if we begin with a root which has
been discovered, and follow it through its wanderings
from language to language. I take the root AR, to
which I alluded in our last Lecture as the source of
the word <emph>Arya</emph>, and we shall thus, while examining its
ramification, learn at the same time why that name
was chosen by the agricultural nomads, the ancestors
of the Aryan race.
</p>

<p>
This root AR<note place='foot'>AR might be traced back
to the Sanskrit root, <emph>ṛi</emph>, to go (Pott, Etymologische
Forschungen, i. 218); but for our present purposes the root, AR,
is sufficient.</note> means <emph>to plough</emph>, to open the soil.
From it we have the Latin <emph>ar-are</emph>, the Greek <emph>ar-oun</emph>,
the Irish <emph>ar</emph>, the Lithuanian <emph>ar-ti</emph>,
the Russian <emph>ora-ti</emph>,
the Gothic <emph>ar-jan</emph>, the Anglo-Saxon <emph>er-jan</emph>, the modern
English <emph>to ear</emph>. Shakespeare says (Richard II.
<hi rend='smallcaps'>iii.</hi> 2),
<q>to ear the land that has some hope to grow.</q>
</p>

<p>
From this we have the name of the plough, or the
instrument of earing: in Latin, <emph>ara-trum</emph>; in Greek,
<emph>aro-tron</emph>; in Bohemian, <emph>oradto</emph>; in Lithuanian,
<emph>arklas</emph>; in Cornish, <emph>aradar</emph>; in Welsh,
<emph>arad</emph>;<note place='foot'>If, as has been supposed, the Cornish and Welsh
words were corruptions of the Latin <emph>arâtrum</emph> they would have appeared as
<emph>areuder</emph>, <emph>arawd</emph>,
respectively.</note> in Old Norse,
<emph>ardhr</emph>. In Old Norse, however, <emph>ardhr</emph>, meaning originally
the plough, came to mean earnings or wealth; the
plough being, in early times, the most essential possession
of the peasant. In the same manner the Latin
<pb n='253'/><anchor id='Pg253'/>
name for money, <emph>pecunia</emph>, was derived from <emph>pecus</emph>, cattle;
the word <emph>fee</emph>, which is now restricted to the payment
made to a doctor or lawyer, was in Old English
<emph>feh</emph>, and in Anglo-Saxon <emph>feoh</emph>, meaning cattle and
wealth; for <emph>feoh</emph>, and Gothic <emph>faihu</emph>, are really the same
word as the Latin <emph>pecus</emph>, the modern German <emph>vieh</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The act of ploughing is called <emph>aratio</emph> in Latin; <emph>arosis</emph>
in Greek: and I believe that <emph>arôma</emph>, in the sense of
perfume, had the same origin; for what is sweeter or
more aromatic than the smell of a ploughed field? In
Genesis, xxviii. 27, Jacob says <q>the smell of my son
is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed.</q>
</p>

<p>
A more primitive formation of the root <emph>ar</emph> seems to
be the Greek <emph>era</emph>, earth, the Sanskrit <emph>irâ</emph>, the Old High-German
<emph>ëro</emph>, the Gaelic <emph>ire</emph>, <emph>irionn</emph>. It meant originally
the ploughed land, afterwards earth in general. Even
the word <emph>earth</emph>, the Gothic <emph>airtha</emph>,<note place='foot'>Grimm
remarks justly that <emph>airtha</emph> could not be derived from <emph>arjan</emph>, on
account of the difference in the vowels. But <emph>airtha</emph> is a much more ancient
formation, and comes from the root <emph>ar</emph>, which root, again, was originally
<emph>ṛi</emph> or <emph>ir</emph> (Benfey, Kurze Gr., p. 27). From this primitive root
<emph>ṛi</emph> or <emph>ir</emph>, we must derive both the Sanskrit <emph>irâ</emph>
or <emph>iḍâ</emph>, and the Gothic <emph>airtha</emph>. The latter
would correspond to the Sanskrit <emph>ṛita</emph>. The true meaning of the Sanskrit
<emph>iḍâ</emph> has never been discovered. The Brahmans explain it as prayer,
but this is not its original meaning.</note> the Anglo-Saxon
<emph>eorthe</emph>, must have been taken originally in the sense
of ploughed or cultivated land. The derivative <emph>ar-mentum</emph>,
formed like <emph>ju-mentum</emph>, would naturally have
been applied to any animal fit for ploughing and other
labor in the field, whether ox or horse.
</p>

<p>
As agriculture was the principal labor in that early
state of society when we must suppose most of our
Aryan words to have been formed and applied to their
definite meanings, we may well understand how a word
which originally meant this special kind of labor, was
<pb n='254'/><anchor id='Pg254'/>
afterwards used to signify labor in general. The general
tendency in the growth of words and their meanings
is from the special to the more general: thus
<emph>gubernare</emph>, which originally meant to steer a ship, took
the general sense of governing. <emph>To equip</emph>, which
originally was to furnish a ship (French <emph>équiper</emph> and
<emph>esquif</emph>, from <emph>schifo</emph>, ship), came to mean furnishing in
general. Now in modern German, <emph>arbeit</emph> means simply
<emph>labor</emph>; <emph>arbeitsam</emph> means industrious. In Gothic,
too, <emph>arbaiþs</emph> is only used to express labor and trouble
in general. But in Old Norse, <emph>erfidhi</emph> means chiefly
<emph>ploughing</emph>, and afterwards labor in general; and the
same word in Anglo-Saxon, <emph>earfodh</emph> or <emph>earfedhe</emph>, is labor.
Of course we might equally suppose that, as laborer,
from meaning one who labors in general, came to take
the special sense of an agricultural laborer, so <emph>arbeit</emph>,
from meaning work in general, came to be applied, in
Old Norse, to the work of ploughing. But as the root
of <emph>erfidhi</emph> seems to be <emph>ar</emph>, our first explanation is the
more plausible. Besides, the simple <emph>ar</emph> in Old Norse
means ploughing and labor, and the Old High-German
<emph>art</emph> has likewise the sense of ploughing.<note place='foot'>Grimm derives
<emph>arbeit</emph>, Gothic <emph>arbaiths</emph>, Old High-German <emph>arapeit</emph>,
Modern High-German <emph>arbeit</emph>, directly from the Gothic <emph>arbja</emph>,
heir; but admits a relationship between <emph>arbja</emph> and the root
<emph>arjan</emph>, to plough. He identifies <emph>arbja</emph> with the Slavonic,
<emph>rab</emph>, servant, slave, and <emph>arbeit</emph> with <emph>rabota</emph>,
<emph>corvée</emph>, supposing that sons and heirs were the first natural slaves. He
supposes
even a relationship between <emph>rabota</emph> and the Latin <emph>labor</emph>. German
Dictionary, s. v. <hi rend='italic'>Arbeit</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Ἄρουρα and <emph>arvum</emph>, a field, would certainly have to
be referred to the root <emph>ar</emph>, to plough. And as ploughing
was not only one of the earliest kinds of labor, but
also one of the most primitive arts, I have no doubt
that the Latin <emph>ars</emph>, <emph>artis</emph>, and our own word <emph>art</emph>,
meant originally the art of all arts, first taught to mortals by
<pb n='255'/><anchor id='Pg255'/>
the goddess of all wisdom, the art of cultivating the
land. In Old High-German <emph>arunti</emph>, in Anglo-Saxon
<emph>ærend</emph>, mean simply work; but they too must originally
have meant the special work of agriculture; and in the
English <emph>errand</emph>, and <emph>errand-boy</emph>, the same word is still
in existence.
</p>

<p>
But <emph>ar</emph> did not only mean to plough, or to cut open
the land; it was transferred at a very early time to the
ploughing of the sea, or rowing. Thus Shakspeare
says:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<lg>
<l><q rend='pre'>Make the sea serve them; which they <emph>ear</emph> and wound</q></l>
<l><q rend='post'>With keels.</q></l>
</lg>
</quote>

<p>
In a similar manner, we find that Sanskrit derives
from <emph>ar</emph> the substantive <emph>aritra</emph>, not in the sense of a
plough, but in the sense of a rudder. In Anglo-Saxon
we find the simple form <emph>âr</emph>, the English <emph>oar</emph>, as it were
the plough-share of the water. The Greek also had
used the root <emph>ar</emph> in the sense of rowing; for
ἐρέτης<note place='foot'>Latin <emph>remus</emph> (O. Irish <emph>rám</emph>) for
<emph>resmus</emph>, connected with ἐρετμός. From
ἐρέτης, ἐρέσσω; and ὑπηρέτης, servant, helper.
<emph>Rostrum</emph> from <emph>rodere</emph>.</note> in
Greek is a rower, and their word τρι-ήρ-ης, meant originally
a ship with three oars, or with three rows of
oars,<note place='foot'>Cf. Eur. Hec. 455, κώπη ἁλιήρης. Ἀμφήρης
means having oars on both sides.</note> a trireme.
</p>

<p>
This comparison of ploughing and rowing is of frequent
occurrence in ancient languages. The English
word <emph>plough</emph>, the Slavonic <emph>ploug</emph>, has been identified
with the Sanskrit <emph>plava</emph>,<note place='foot'>From Sanskrit <emph>plu</emph>,
πλέω; cf. fleet and float.</note> a ship, and with the Greek
<emph>ploion</emph>, ship. As the Aryans spoke of a ship ploughing
the sea, they also spoke of a plough sailing across
the field; and thus it was that the same names were
<pb n='256'/><anchor id='Pg256'/>
applied to both.<note place='foot'>Other similes: ὕνις, and ὕννις, ploughshare, derived
by Plutarch from ὗς, boar. A plough is said to be called a pigsnose. The Latin
<emph>porca</emph>, a ploughed field, is derived from <emph>porcus</emph>, hog; and the
German <emph>furicha</emph>, furrow, is connected with <emph>farah</emph>, boar.
The Sanskrit <emph>vṛika</emph>, wolf, from <emph>vraśch</emph>, to tear, is used for
plough, Rv. i. 117, 21. <emph>Godaraņa</emph>, earth-tearer, is another
word for plough in Sanskrit. Gothic <emph>hoha</emph>, plough = Sk. <emph>koka</emph>,
wolf. See Grimm, Deutsche Sprache, and Kuhn, Indische Studien, vol. i. p. 321.</note>
In English dialects, <emph>plough</emph> or <emph>plow</emph>
is still used in the general sense of waggon or conveyance.<note place='foot'>In the
Vale of Blackmore, a waggon is called <emph>plough</emph>, or <emph>plow</emph>, and
<emph>zull</emph>
(A.-S. syl) is used for <emph>aratrum</emph> (Barnes, Dorset Dialect, p. 369).</note>
</p>

<p>
We might follow the offshoots of this root <emph>ar</emph> still
further, but the number of words which we have examined
in various languages will suffice to show
what is meant by a predicative root. In all these
words <emph>ar</emph> is the radical element, all the rest is merely
formative. The root <emph>ar</emph> is called a predicative root,
because in whatever composition it enters, it predicates
one and the same conception, whether of the plough,
or the rudder, or the ox, or the field. Even in such
a word as <emph>artistic</emph>, the predicative power of the root <emph>ar</emph>
may still be perceived, though, of course, as it were by
means of a powerful telescope only. The Brahmans
who called themselves <emph>ârya</emph> in India, were no more
aware of the real origin of this name and its connection
with agricultural labor, than the artist who now
speaks of <emph>his art</emph> as a divine inspiration suspects that
the word which he uses was originally applicable only
to so primitive an art as that of ploughing.
</p>

<p>
We shall now examine another family of words, in
order to see by what process the radical elements of
words were first discovered.
</p>

<p>
Let us take the word <emph>respectable</emph>. It is a word of
Latin not of Saxon, origin, as we see by the termination
<pb n='257'/><anchor id='Pg257'/>
<emph>able</emph>. In <emph>respectabilis</emph> we easily distinguish the verb
<emph>respectare</emph> and the termination <emph>bilis</emph>. We then separate
the prefix <emph>re</emph>, which leaves <emph>spectare</emph>, and we trace
<emph>spectare</emph> as a participial formation back to the Latin verb
<emph>spicere</emph> or <emph>specere</emph>, meaning to see, to look. In
<emph>specere</emph>, again, we distinguish between the changeable termination
<emph>ere</emph> and the unchangeable remnant <emph>spec</emph>, which we
call the root. This root we expect to find in Sanskrit
and the other Aryan languages; and so we do. In
Sanskrit the more usual form is <emph>paś</emph>, to see, without the
<emph>s</emph>; but <emph>spaś</emph> also is found in <emph>spaśa</emph>, a spy, in
<emph>spashṭa</emph> (in <emph>vi-spashṭa</emph>), clear, manifest, and in the Vedic
<emph>spaś</emph>, a guardian. In the Teutonic family we find <emph>spëhôn</emph> in
Old High-German meaning to look, to spy, to contemplate;
and <emph>spëha</emph>, the English spy.<note place='foot'>Pott,
Etymologische Forschungen, p. 267; Benfey, Griechisches Wurzelwörterbuch,
p. 236.</note> In Greek, the root <emph>spek</emph> has
been changed into <emph>skep</emph>, which exists in <emph>skeptomai</emph>,
I look, I examine; from whence <emph>skeptikos</emph>, an
examiner or inquirer, in theological language, a sceptic;
and <emph>episkopos</emph>, an overseer, a bishop. Let us now examine
the various ramifications of this root. Beginning
with <emph>respectable</emph>, we found that it originally meant a
person who deserves <emph>respect</emph>, <emph>respect</emph> meaning <emph>looking
back</emph>. We pass by common objects or persons without
noticing them, whereas we turn back to look again at
those which deserve our admiration, our regard, our
respect. This was the original meaning of <emph>respect</emph> and
<emph>respectable</emph>, nor need we be surprised at this if we consider
that <emph>noble</emph>, <emph>nobilis</emph> in Latin, conveyed originally
no more than the idea of a person that deserves to be
known; for <emph>nobilis</emph> stands for <emph>gnobilis</emph>, just as
<emph>nomen</emph>
stands for <emph>gnomen</emph>, or <emph>natus</emph> for <emph>gnatus</emph>.
</p>

<pb n='258'/><anchor id='Pg258'/>

<p>
<q>With respect to</q> has now become almost a mere
preposition. For if we say, <q>With respect to this
point I have no more to say,</q> this is the same as <q>I
have no more to say on this point.</q>
</p>

<p>
Again, as in looking back we single out a person,
the adjective <emph>respective</emph>, and the adverb <emph>respectively</emph>,
are used almost in the same sense as special, or singly.
</p>

<p>
The English <emph>respite</emph> is the Norman modification of
<emph>respectus</emph>, the French <emph>répit</emph>. <emph>Répit</emph> meant originally
looking back, reviewing the whole evidence. A criminal
received so many days <emph>ad respectum</emph>, to re-examine
the case. Afterwards it was said that the prisoner had
received a respit, that is to say, had obtained a re-examination;
and at last a verb was formed, and it was
said that a person had been respited.
</p>

<p>
As <emph>specere</emph>, to see, with the preposition <emph>re</emph>, came to
mean respect, so with the preposition <emph>de</emph>, down, it forms
the Latin <emph>despicere</emph>, meaning to look down, the English
<emph>despise</emph>. The French <emph>dépit</emph> (Old French <emph>despit</emph>) means
no longer contempt, though it is the Latin <emph>despectus</emph>,
but rather <emph>anger</emph>, <emph>vexation</emph>. <emph>Se dépiter</emph> is to be
vexed, to fret. <q><emph>En dépit de lui</emph></q> is originally <q>angry with
him,</q> then <q>in spite of him;</q> and the English <emph>spite</emph>,
<emph>in spite of</emph>, <emph>spiteful</emph>, are mere abbreviations
of <emph>despite</emph>, <emph>in
despite of</emph>, <emph>despiteful</emph>, and have nothing whatever to do
with the spitting of cats.
</p>

<p>
As <emph>de</emph> means down from above, so <emph>sub</emph> means up from
below, and this added to <emph>specere</emph>, to look, gives us <emph>suspicere</emph>,
<emph>suspicari</emph>, to look up, in the sense of to
suspect.<note place='foot'>The Greek υποδρα, askance, is derived from ὑπὸ, and δρα,
which is connected with δέρκομαι, I see; the Sanskrit, dṛiś.</note>
From it <emph>suspicion</emph>, <emph>suspicious</emph>; and likewise the French
<pb n='259'/><anchor id='Pg259'/>
<emph>soupçon</emph>, even in such phrases as <q>there is a soupçon
of chicory in this coffee,</q> meaning just a touch, just
the smallest atom of chicory.
</p>

<p>
As <emph>circum</emph> means round about, so <emph>circumspect</emph> means,
of course, cautious, careful.
</p>

<p>
With <emph>in</emph>, meaning into, <emph>specere</emph> forms <emph>inspicere</emph>, to
inspect; hence <emph>inspector</emph>, <emph>inspection</emph>.
</p>

<p>
With <emph>ad</emph>, towards, <emph>specere</emph> becomes <emph>adspicere</emph>, to
look at a thing. Hence <emph>adspectus</emph>, the aspect, the look or
appearance of things.
</p>

<p>
So with <emph>pro</emph>, forward, <emph>specere</emph> became <emph>prospicere</emph>;
and gave rise to such words as <emph>prospectus</emph>, as it were a
look out, <emph>prospective</emph>, &amp;c. With <emph>con</emph>, with,
<emph>spicere</emph> forms <emph>conspicere</emph>, to see together,
<emph>conspectus</emph>, <emph>conspicuous</emph>. We
saw before in <emph>respectable</emph>, that a new word <emph>spectare</emph> is
formed from the participle of <emph>spicere</emph>. This, with the
preposition <emph>ex</emph>, out, gives us the Latin <emph>expectare</emph>, the
English <emph>to expect</emph>, to look out; with its derivatives.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Auspicious</emph> is another word which contains our root
as the second of its component elements. The Latin
<emph>auspicium</emph> stands for <emph>avispicium</emph>, and meant the looking
out for certain birds which were considered to be
of good or bad omen to the success of any public or
private act. Hence <emph>auspicious</emph>, in the sense of lucky.
<emph>Haru-spex</emph> was the name given to a person who foretold
the future from the inspection of the entrails of
animals.
</p>

<p>
Again, from <emph>specere</emph>, <emph>speculum</emph> was formed, in the
sense of looking-glass, or any other means of looking
at oneself; and from it <emph>speculari</emph>, the English <emph>to speculate</emph>,
<emph>speculative</emph>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
But there are many more offshoots of this one root.
Thus, the Latin <emph>speculum</emph>, looking-glass, became <emph>specchio</emph>
<pb n='260'/><anchor id='Pg260'/>
in Italian; and the same word, though in a roundabout
way, came into French as the adjective <emph>espiègle</emph>,
waggish. The origin of this French word is curious.
There exists in German a famous cycle of stories,
mostly tricks, played by a half-historical, half-mythical
character of the name of <emph>Eulenspiegel</emph>, or <emph>Owl-glass</emph>.
These stories were translated into French, and the hero
was known at first by the name of <emph>Ulespiègle</emph>, which
name, contracted afterwards into <emph>Espiègle</emph>, became a
general name for every wag.
</p>

<p>
As the French borrowed not only from Latin, but
likewise from the Teutonic languages, we meet there
side by side with the derivatives of the Latin <emph>specere</emph>,
the old High-German, <emph>spëhôn</emph>, slightly disguised as <emph>épier</emph>,
to spy, the Italian <emph>spiare</emph>. The German word for a
spy was <emph>spëha</emph>, and this appears in old French as <emph>espie</emph>,
in modern French as <emph>espion</emph>.
</p>

<p>
One of the most prolific branches of the same root
is the Latin <emph>species</emph>. Whether we take <emph>species</emph> in the
sense of a perennial succession of similar individuals
in continual generations (<emph>Jussieu</emph>), or look upon it
as existing only as a category of thought (<emph>Agassiz</emph>),
<emph>species</emph> was intended originally as the literal translation
of the Greek <emph>eidos</emph> as opposed to <emph>genos</emph>, or <emph>genus</emph>.
The Greeks classified things originally according to
<emph>kind</emph> and <emph>form</emph>, and though these terms were afterwards
technically defined by Aristotle, their etymological
meaning is in reality the most appropriate.
Things may be classified either because they are of
the same <emph>genus</emph> or <emph>kind</emph>, that is to say, because they
had the same origin; this gives us a genealogical classification:
or they can be classified because they have
the same appearance, <emph>eidos</emph>, or <emph>form</emph>, without claiming
for them a common origin; and this gives us a morphological
<pb n='261'/><anchor id='Pg261'/>
classification. It was, however, in the Aristotelian,
and not in its etymological sense, that the
Greek <emph>eidos</emph> was rendered in Latin by <emph>species</emph>, meaning
the subdivision of a genus, the class of a family.
Hence the French <emph>espèce</emph>, a kind; the English <emph>special</emph>,
in the sense of particular as opposed to general. There
is little of the root <emph>spaś</emph>, to see, left in a <emph>special train</emph>,
or a <emph>special messenger</emph>; yet the connection, though not
apparent, can be restored with perfect certainty. We
frequently hear the expression <emph>to specify</emph>. A man
specifies his grievances. What does it mean? The
mediæval Latin <emph>specificus</emph> is a literal translation of the
Greek <emph>eidopoios</emph>. This means what makes or constitutes
an <emph>eidos</emph> or species. Now, in classification, what
constitutes a species is that particular quality which,
superadded to other qualities, shared in common by
all the members of a genus, distinguishes one class
from all other classes. Thus the specific character
which distinguishes man from all other animals, is
reason or language. Specific, therefore, assumed the sense of
<emph>distinguishing</emph> or <emph>distinct</emph>, and the verb <emph>to specify</emph>
conveyed the meaning of enumerating distinctly,
or one by one. I finish with the French <emph>épicier</emph>, a
respectable grocer, but originally a man who sold
drugs. The different kinds of drugs which the apothecary
had to sell, were spoken of, with a certain learned
air, as <emph>species</emph>, not as drugs in general, but as peculiar
drugs and special medicines. Hence the chymist or
apothecary is still called <emph>Speziale</emph> in Italian, his shop
<emph>spezieria</emph>.<note place='foot'>Generi coloniali,
colonial goods. Marsh, p. 253. In Spanish, generos,
merchandise.</note> In French <emph>species</emph>, which regularly became
<emph>espèce</emph>, assumed a new form to express drugs, namely
<emph>épices</emph>; the English <emph>spices</emph>, the German <emph>spezereien</emph>.
<pb n='262'/><anchor id='Pg262'/>
Hence the famous <emph>pain d'épices</emph>, gingerbread nuts, and
<emph>épicier</emph>, a grocer. If you try for a moment to trace
<emph>spicy</emph>, or <emph>a well-spiced</emph> article, back to the simple root
<emph>specere</emph>, to look, you will understand that marvellous
power of language which out of a few simple elements
has created a variety of names hardly surpassed by the
unbounded variety of nature herself.<note place='foot'>Many derivatives might have
been added, such as <emph>specimen</emph>, <emph>spectator</emph>,
<emph>le spectacle</emph>, <emph>specialité</emph>, <emph>spectrum</emph>,
<emph>spectacles</emph>, <emph>specious</emph>, <emph>specula</emph>, &amp;c.</note>
</p>

<p>
I say <q>out of a few simple elements,</q> for the number
of what we call full predicative roots, such as <emph>ar</emph>,
to plough, or <emph>spaś</emph>, to look, is indeed small.
</p>

<p>
A root is necessarily monosyllabic. Roots consisting
of more than one syllable can always be proved to
be derivative roots, and even among monosyllabic
roots it is necessary to distinguish between primitive,
secondary, and tertiary roots.
</p>

<p>
A. Primitive roots are those which consist&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
(1) of one vowel; for instance, <emph>i</emph>, to go;
</p>

<p>
(2) of one vowel and one consonant; for instance,
<emph>ad</emph>, to eat;
</p>

<p>
(3) of one consonant and one vowel; for instance,
<emph>dâ</emph>, to give.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
B. Secondary roots are those which consist&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
(1) of one consonant, vowel, and consonant; for
instance, <emph>tud</emph>, to strike.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
In these roots either the first or the last consonant
is modificatory.
</p>

<p>
C. Tertiary roots are those which consist&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
(1) of consonant, consonant, and vowel; for instance,
<emph>plu</emph>, to flow;
</p>

<p>
(2) of vowel, consonant, and consonant; for instance,
<emph>ard</emph>, to hurt;
</p>

<pb n='263'/><anchor id='Pg263'/>

<p>
(3) of consonant, consonant, vowel, and consonant;
for instance, <emph>spaś</emph>, to see;
</p>

<p>
(4) of consonant, consonant, vowel, consonant,
and consonant; for instance, <emph>spand</emph>, to
tremble.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
The primary roots are the most important in the
early history of language; but their predicative power
being generally of too indefinite a character to answer
the purposes of advancing thought, they were soon encroached
upon and almost supplanted by secondary and
tertiary radicals.
</p>

<p>
In the secondary roots we can frequently observe
that one of the consonants, in the Aryan languages,
generally the final, is liable to modification. The root
retains its general meaning, which is slightly modified
and determined by the changes of the final consonants.
Thus, besides <emph>tud</emph> (<emph>tudati</emph>), we have in Sanskrit
<emph>tup</emph> (<emph>topati</emph>, <emph>tupati</emph>, and <emph>tumpati</emph>),
meaning to strike; Greek, <emph>typ-tō</emph>. We meet likewise with <emph>tubh</emph>
(<emph>tubhnâti</emph>, <emph>tubhyati</emph>,
<emph>tobhate</emph>), to strike; and, according to Sanskrit grammarians, with
<emph>tuph</emph> (<emph>tophati</emph>, <emph>tuphati</emph>, <emph>tumphati</emph>).
Then there is a root <emph>tuj</emph> (<emph>tunjati</emph>, <emph>tojati</emph>), to
strike, to excite;
another root, <emph>tur</emph> (<emph>tutorti</emph>), to which the same meaning
is ascribed; another, <emph>tûr</emph> (<emph>tûryate</emph>), to hurt. Then
there is the further derivative <emph>turv</emph> (<emph>tûrvati</emph>), to strike,
to conquer; there is <emph>tuh</emph> (<emph>tohati</emph>), to pain, to vex; and
there is <emph>tuś</emph> (<emph>tośate</emph>), to which Sanskrit grammarians
attribute the sense of striking.
</p>

<p>
Although we may call all these verbal bases roots,
they stand to the first class in about the same relation
as the triliteral Semitic roots to the more primitive
biliteral.<note place='foot'>Benloew, Aperçu Général, p. 28
<hi rend='italic'>seq.</hi></note>
</p>

<pb n='264'/><anchor id='Pg264'/>

<p>
In the third class we shall find that one of the two
consonants is always a semivowel, nasal, or sibilant,
these being more variable than the other consonants;
and we can almost always point to one consonant as
of later origin, and added to a biconsonantal root in
order to render its meaning more special. Thus we
have, besides <emph>spaś</emph>, the root <emph>paś</emph>, and even this root
has been traced back by Pott to a more primitive <emph>aś</emph>.
Thus <emph>vand</emph>, again, is a mere strengthening of the root
<emph>vad</emph>, like <emph>mand</emph> of <emph>mad</emph>, like
<emph>yu-na-j</emph> and <emph>yu-n-j</emph> of <emph>yuj</emph>.
The root <emph>yuj</emph>, to join, and <emph>yudh</emph>, to fight, both point
back to a root <emph>yu</emph>, to mingle, and this simple root has
been preserved in Sanskrit. We may well understand
that a root, having the general meaning of mingling or
being together, should be employed to express both the
friendly joining of hands and the engaging in hostile
combat; but we may equally understand that language,
in its progress to clearness and definiteness,
should have desired a distinction between these two
meanings, and should gladly have availed herself of
the two derivatives, <emph>yuj</emph> and <emph>yudh</emph>, to mark this distinction.
</p>

<p>
Sanskrit grammarians have reduced the whole
growth of their language to 1706 roots,<note place='foot'><p>Benfey,
Grammatik, § 147:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
Roots of the 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 classes: 226<lb/>
Roots of the 1, 4, 6, 10 classes: 1480<lb/>
Total: 1706, including 143 of the 10th class.
</p></note> that is to
say, they have admitted so many radicals in order to
derive from them, according to their system of grammatical
derivation, all nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns,
prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions, which
<pb n='265'/><anchor id='Pg265'/>
occur in Sanskrit. According to our explanation of
a root, however, this number of 1706 would have
to be reduced considerably, and though a few new
roots would likewise have to be added which Sanskrit
grammarians failed to discover, yet the number
of primitive sounds, expressive of definite meanings,
requisite for the etymological analysis of the whole
Sanskrit dictionary would not amount to even one
third of that number. Hebrew has been reduced to
about 500 roots,<note place='foot'>Renan, Histoire des Langues sémitiques, p. 138.
Benloew estimates the necessary radicals of Gothic at 600, of modern German at 250, p. 22.
Pott thinks that each language has about 1000 roots.</note> and I doubt whether we want a
larger number for Sanskrit. This shows a wise
spirit of economy on the part of primitive language,
for the possibility of forming new roots for every
new impression was almost unlimited. Even if we
put the number of letters only at twenty-four, the
possible number of biliteral and triliteral roots would
amount together to 14,400; whereas Chinese, though
abstaining from composition and derivation, and therefore
requiring a larger number of radicals than any
other language, was satisfied with about 450. With
these 450 sounds raised to 1263 by various accents and
intonations, the Chinese have produced a dictionary of
from 40,000 to 50,000 words.<note place='foot'>The
exact number in the Imperial Dictionary of Khang-hi amounts to
42,718. About one-fourth part has become obsolete; and one-half of the
rest may be considered of rare occurrence, thus leaving only about 15,000
words in actual use. <q>The exact number of the classical characters is
42,718. Many of them are no longer in use in the modern language, but
they occur in the canonical and in the classical books. They may be found
sometimes in official documents, when an attempt is made at imitating the
old style. A considerable portion of these are names of persons, places,

It is clear, however, that in addition to these predicative
roots, we want another class of radical elements
to enable us to account for the full growth of language.
With the 400 or 500 predicative roots at her disposal,
language would not have been at a loss to coin names
for all things that come under our cognizance. Language
is a thrifty housewife. Consider the variety
of ideas that were expressed by the one root <emph>spaś</emph>, and
you will see that with 500 such roots she might form a
dictionary sufficient to satisfy the wants, however extravagant,
of her husband&mdash;the human mind. If
each root yielded fifty derivatives, we should have
25,000 words. Now, we are told, on good authority,
by a country clergyman, that some of the laborers in
his parish had not 300 words in their vocabulary.<note place='foot'>The study
of the English language by A. D'Orsey, p. 15.</note>
The vocabulary of the ancient sages of Egypt, at least
as far as it is known to us from the hieroglyphic inscriptions,
amounts to about 685 words.<note place='foot'>This is the
number of words in the Vocabulary given by Bunsen, in
the first volume of his Egypt, pp. 453-491. Several of these words, however,
though identical in sound, must be separated etymologically, and later
researches have still further increased the number. The number of hieroglyphic
groups in Sharpe's <q>Egyptian Hieroglyphics,</q> 1861, amounts to
2030.</note> The <emph>libretto</emph>
of an Italian opera seldom displays a greater variety of
words.<note place='foot'>Marsh, Lectures, p. 182. M. Thommerel stated the number of words
in the Dictionaries of Robertson and Webster as 43,566. Todd's edition
of Johnson, however, is said to contain 58,000 words, and the later editions
of Webster have reached the number of 70,000, counting the participles of
the present and perfect as independent vocables. Flügel estimated the
number of words in his own dictionary at 94,464, of which 65,085 are simple,
29,379 compound. This was in 1843; and he then expressed a hope
that in his next edition the number of words would far exceed 100,000.
This is the number fixed upon by Mr. Marsh as the minimum of the <emph>copia
vocabulorum</emph> in English. See <hi rend='italic'>Saturday Review</hi>,
Nov. 2, 1861.</note> A well-educated person in England, who has

been at a public school and at the university, who reads
his Bible, his Shakespeare, the <q>Times,</q> and all the
books of Mudie's Library, seldom uses more than about
3000 or 4000 words in actual conversation. Accurate
thinkers and close reasoners, who avoid vague and general
expressions, and wait till they find the word that
exactly fits their meaning, employ a larger stock; and
eloquent speakers may rise to a command of 10,000.
Shakespeare, who displayed a greater variety of expression
than probably any writer in any language, produced
all his plays with about 15,000 words. Milton's
works are built up with 8000; and the Old Testament
says all that it has to say with 5,642
words.<note place='foot'>Renan, Histoire, p. 138.</note>

<p>
Five hundred roots, therefore, considering their fertility
and pliancy, was more than was wanted for the
dictionary of our primitive ancestors. And yet they
wanted something more. If they had a root expressive
of light and splendor, that root might have formed
the predicate in the names of sun, and moon, and stars,
and heaven, day, morning, dawn, spring, gladness, joy,
beauty, majesty, love, friend, gold, riches, &amp;c. But if
they wanted to express <emph>here</emph> and <emph>there</emph>, <emph>who</emph>,
<emph>what</emph>, <emph>this</emph>, <emph>that</emph>, <emph>thou</emph>,
<emph>he</emph>, they would have found it impossible to
find any predicative root that could be applied to this
purpose. Attempts have indeed been made to trace
these words back to predicative roots; but if we are
told that the demonstrative root <emph>ta</emph>, this or there, may
be derived from a predicative root <emph>tan</emph>, to extend, we
find that even in our modern languages, the demonstrative
pronouns and particles are of too primitive and
independent a nature to allow of so artificial an interpretation.
The sound <emph>ta</emph> or <emph>sa</emph>, for this or there, is as involuntary,
as natural, as independent an expression as any
<pb n='268'/><anchor id='Pg268'/>
of the predicative roots, and although some of these demonstrative,
or pronominal, or local roots, for all these
names have been applied to them, may be traced back
to a predicative source, we must admit a small class of
independent radicals, not predicative in the usual sense
of the word, but simply pointing, simply expressive of
existence under certain more or less definite, local or
temporal prescriptions.
</p>

<p>
It will be best to give one illustration at least of a
pronominal root and its influence in the formation of
words.
</p>

<p>
In some languages, and particularly in Chinese, a
predicative root may by itself be used as a noun, or
a verb, or an adjective or adverb. Thus the Chinese
sound <emph>ta</emph> means, without any change of form, great,
greatness, and to be great.<note place='foot'>Endlicher, Chinesische
Grammatik, § 128.</note> If <emph>ta</emph> stands before a
substantive, it has the meaning of an adjective. Thus
<emph>ta jin</emph> means a great man. If <emph>ta</emph> stands after a substantive,
it is a predicate, or, as we should say, a
verb. Thus <emph>jin ta</emph> (or jin ta ye) would mean the
man is great.<note place='foot'><p>If two words are placed
like <emph>jin ta</emph>, the first may form the predicate of
the second, the second being used as a substantive. Thus <emph>jin ta</emph> might mean
the greatness of man, but in this case it is more usual to say <emph>jin tci ta</emph>.
</p>
<p>
<q>Another instance, <emph>chen</emph>, virtue; Ex. jin tchi chen,
the virtue of man; <emph>chen</emph>, virtuous; Ex. chen jin, the
virtuous man; <emph>chen</emph>, to approve; Ex. chen tchi,
to find it good; <emph>chen</emph>, well; Ex. chen ko, to sing
well.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Stanislas Julien.</hi></p></note> Or again,
</p>

<lg>
<l>ģin ngŏ, li pŭ ngŏ,</l>
<l>would mean,  man    bad,  law  not   bad.</l>
</lg>

<p>
Here we see that there is no outward distinction whatever
between a root and a word, and that a noun is
distinguished from a verb merely by its collocation in
a sentence.
</p>

<p>
In other languages, however, and particularly in the
<pb n='269'/><anchor id='Pg269'/>
Aryan languages, no predicative root can by itself form
a word. Thus in Latin there is a root <emph>luc</emph>, to shine. In
order to have a substantive, such as light, it was necessary
to add a pronominal or demonstrative root, this
forming the general subject of which the meaning contained
in the root is to be predicated. Thus by the
addition of the pronominal element <emph>s</emph> we have the
Latin noun, <emph>luc-s</emph>, the light, or literally, shining-there.
Let us add a personal pronoun, and we have the verb
<emph>luc-e-s</emph>, shining-thou, thou shinest. Let us add other
pronominal derivatives, and we get the adjectives, <emph>lucidus</emph>,
<emph>luculentus</emph>, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
It would be a totally mistaken view, however, were
we to suppose that all derivative elements, all that remains
of a word after the predicative root has been removed,
must be traced back to pronominal roots. We
have only to look at some of our own modern derivatives
in order to be convinced that many of them were
originally predicative, that they entered into composition
with the principal predicative root, and then dwindled
down to mere suffixes. Thus <emph>scape</emph> in <emph>landscape</emph>,
and the more modern <emph>ship</emph> in <emph>hardship</emph> are both derived
from the same root which we have in Gothic,<note place='foot'>Grimm, Deutsche
Grammatik, b. ii. s. 521.</note> <emph>skapa</emph>,
<emph>skôp</emph>, <emph>skôpum</emph>, to create; in Anglo-Saxon, <emph>scape</emph>,
<emph>scôp</emph>, <emph>scôpon</emph>. It is the same as the German derivative,
<emph>schaft</emph>, in <emph>Gesellschaft</emph>, &amp;c. So again
<emph>dom</emph> in <emph>wisdom</emph> or <emph>christendom</emph>
is derived from the same root which we have in
<emph>to do</emph>. It is the same as the German <emph>thum</emph>
in <emph>Christenthum</emph>,
the Anglo-Saxon <emph>dôm</emph> in <emph>cyning-dom</emph>, <emph>Königthum</emph>.
Sometimes it may seem doubtful whether a derivative
element was originally merely demonstrative or predicative.
Thus the termination of the comparative in
<pb n='270'/><anchor id='Pg270'/>
Sanskrit is <emph>tara</emph>, the Greek <emph>teros</emph>. This might, at first
sight, be taken for a demonstrative element, but it is in
reality the root <emph>tar</emph>, which means <emph>to go beyond</emph>, which
we have likewise in the Latin <emph>trans</emph>. This <emph>trans</emph> in its
French form <emph>très</emph> is prefixed to adjectives in order to
express a higher or transcendent degree, and the same
root was well adapted to form the comparative in the
ancient Aryan tongues. This root must likewise be
admitted in one of the terminations of the locative
which is <emph>tra</emph> in Sanskrit; for instance from <emph>ta</emph>, a demonstrative
root, we form <emph>ta-tra</emph>, there, originally this
way; we form <emph>anyatra</emph>, in another way; the same as
in Latin we say <emph>ali-ter</emph>, from <emph>aliud</emph>; compounds no
more surprising than the French <emph>autrement</emph> (see p. 55)
and the English <emph>otherwise</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Most of the terminations of declension and conjugation
are demonstrative roots, and the <emph>s</emph>, for instance, of
the third person singular, he loves, can be proved to
have been originally the demonstrative pronoun of the
third person. It was originally not <emph>s</emph> but <emph>t</emph>. This will
require some explanation. The termination of the third
person singular of the present is <emph>ti</emph> in Sanskrit. Thus
<emph>dâ</emph>, to give, becomes <emph>dadâti</emph>, he gives; <emph>dhâ</emph>, to
place, <emph>dadhâti</emph>, he places.
</p>

<p>
In Greek this <emph>ti</emph> is changed into <emph>si</emph>; just as the Sanskrit
<emph>tvam</emph>, the Latin <emph>tu</emph>, thou, appears in Greek as <emph>sy</emph>.
Thus Greek <emph>didōsi</emph> corresponds to Sanskrit <emph>dadâti</emph>;
<emph>tithēsi</emph> to <emph>dadhâti</emph>. In the course of time, however,
every Greek <emph>s</emph> between two vowels, in a termination,
was elided. Thus <emph>genos</emph> does not form the genitive
<emph>genesos</emph>, like the Latin <emph>genus</emph>, <emph>genesis</emph> or
<emph>generis</emph>, but <emph>geneos</emph> = <emph>genous</emph>. The dative is not
<emph>genesi</emph> (the Latin <emph>generi</emph>), but <emph>geneï</emph> =
<emph>genei</emph>. In the same manner all the
<pb n='271'/><anchor id='Pg271'/>
regular verbs have <emph>ei</emph> for the termination of the third
person singular. But this <emph>ei</emph> stands for <emph>esi</emph>. Thus
<emph>typtei</emph> stands for <emph>typtesi</emph>, and this for <emph>typteti</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The Latin drops the final <emph>i</emph>, and instead of <emph>ti</emph> has
<emph>t</emph>.
Thus we get <emph>amat</emph>, <emph>dicit</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Now there is a law to which I alluded before, which
is called Grimm's Law. According to it every tenuis
in Latin is in Gothic represented by its corresponding
aspirate. Hence, instead of <emph>t</emph>, we should expect in
Gothic <emph>th</emph>; and so we find indeed in Gothic <emph>habaiþ</emph>,
instead of Latin <emph>habet</emph>. This aspirate likewise appears
in Anglo-Saxon, where <emph>he loves</emph> is <emph>lufað</emph>. It is preserved
in the Biblical <emph>he loveth</emph>, and it is only in modern English
that it gradually sank to <emph>s</emph>. In the <emph>s</emph> of <emph>he loves</emph>,
therefore, we have a demonstrative root, added to the
predicative root <emph>love</emph>, and this <emph>s</emph> is originally the same
as the Sanskrit <emph>ti</emph>. This <emph>ti</emph> again must be traced back
to the demonstrative root <emph>ta</emph>, this or there; which exists
in the Sanskrit demonstrative pronoun <emph>tad</emph>, the Greek
<emph>to</emph>, the Gothic <emph>thata</emph>, the English <emph>that</emph>; and which
in Latin we can trace in <emph>talis</emph>, <emph>tantus</emph>,
<emph>tunc</emph>, <emph>tam</emph>, and even
in <emph>tamen</emph>, an old locative in <emph>men</emph>. We have thus seen
that what we call the third person singular of the
present is in reality a simple compound of a predicative
root with a demonstrative root. It is a compound like
any other, only that the second part is not predicative,
but simply demonstrative. As in pay-master we predicate
pay of master, meaning a person whose office it is
to pay, so in <emph>dadâ-ti</emph>, <emph>give-he</emph>, the ancient framers of language
simply predicated giving of some third person,
and this synthetic proposition, <emph>give-he</emph>, is the same as
what we now call the third person singular in the
<pb n='272'/><anchor id='Pg272'/>
indicative mood, of the present tense, in the active
voice.<note place='foot'>Each verb in Greek, if conjugated through all its voices,
tenses, moods, and persons, yields, together with its participles, about 1300
forms.</note>
</p>

<p>
We have necessarily confined ourselves in our analysis
of language to that family of languages to which
our own tongue, and those with which we are best acquainted,
belong; but what applies to Sanskrit and the
Aryan family applies to the whole realm of human
speech. Every language, without a single exception,
that has as yet been cast into the crucible of comparative
grammar, has been found to contain these two substantial
elements, predicative and demonstrative roots.
In the Semitic family these two constituent elements
are even more palpable than in Sanskrit and Greek.
Even before the discovery of Sanskrit, and the rise of
comparative philology, Semitic scholars had successfully
traced back the whole dictionary of Hebrew and Arabic
to a small number of roots, and as every root in
these languages consists of three consonants, the Semitic
languages have sometimes been called by the name
of triliteral.
</p>

<p>
To a still higher degree the constituent elements are,
as it were, on the very surface in the Turanian family
of speech. It is one of the characteristic features of
that family, that, whatever the number of prefixes and
suffixes, the root must always stand out in full relief,
and must never be allowed to suffer by its contact with
derivative elements.
</p>

<p>
There is one language, the Chinese, in which no
analysis of any kind is required for the discovery of its
component parts. It is a language in which no coalescence
<pb n='273'/><anchor id='Pg273'/>
of roots has taken place: every word is a root,
and every root is a word. It is, in fact, the most primitive
stage in which we can imagine human language
to have existed. It is language <emph>comme il faut</emph>; it is
what we should naturally have expected all languages
to be.
</p>

<p>
There are, no doubt, numerous dialects in Asia,
Africa, America, and Polynesia, which have not yet
been dissected by the knife of the grammarian; but we
may be satisfied at least with this negative evidence,
that, as yet, no language which has passed through
the ordeal of grammatical analysis has ever disclosed
any but these two constituent elements.
</p>

<p>
The problem, therefore, of the origin of language,
which seemed so perplexing and mysterious to the ancient
philosophers, assumes a much simpler aspect with
us. We have learnt what language is made of; we
have found that everything in language, except the
roots, is intelligible, and can be accounted for. There
is nothing to surprise us in the combination of the
predicative and demonstrative roots which led to the
building up of all the languages with which we are
acquainted, from Chinese to English. It is not only
conceivable, as Professor Pott remarks, <q>that the formation
of the Sanskrit language, as it is handed down
to us, may have been preceded by a state of the greatest
simplicity and entire absence of inflections, such
as is exhibited to the present day by the Chinese and
other monosyllabic languages.</q> It is absolutely impossible
that it should have been otherwise. After we
have seen that all languages must have started from
this Chinese or monosyllabic stage, the only portion of
the problem of the origin of language that remains to
<pb n='274'/><anchor id='Pg274'/>
be solved is this: How can we account for the origin
of those predicative and demonstrative roots which form
the constituent elements of all human speech, and
which have hitherto resisted all attempts at further
analysis? This problem will form the subject of our
two next Lectures.

<head>Lecture VIII. Morphological Classification.</head>

<p>
We finished in our last Lecture our analysis of language,
and we arrived at the result that <emph>predicative</emph> and
<emph>demonstrative</emph> roots are the sole constituent elements of
human speech.
</p>

<p>
We now turn back in order to discover how many
possible forms of language may be produced by the free
combination of these constituent elements; and we
shall then endeavor to find out whether each of these
possible forms has its real counterpart in some or other of
the dialects of mankind. We are attempting in fact to
carry out a <emph>morphological classification</emph> of speech, which
is based entirely on the form or manner in which roots
are put together, and therefore quite independent of the
genealogical classification which, according to its very
nature, is based on the formations of language handed
down ready made from generation to generation.
</p>

<p>
Before, however, we enter on this, the principal subject
of our present Lecture, we have still to examine,
as briefly as possible, a second family of speech, which,
like the Aryan, is established on the strictest principles
of genealogical classification, namely, the <emph>Semitic</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The Semitic family is divided into three branches,
the <emph>Aramaic</emph>, the <emph>Hebraic</emph>, and the
<emph>Arabic</emph>.<note place='foot'>Histoire Générale et
Système Comparé des Langues sémitiques, par

<pb n='276'/><anchor id='Pg276'/>

<p>
The <emph>Aramaic</emph> occupies the north, including Syria,
Mesopotamia, and part of the ancient kingdoms of Babylonia
and Assyria. It is known to us chiefly in two
dialects, the <emph>Syriac</emph> and <emph>Chaldee</emph>. The former name is
given to the language which has been preserved to us
in a translation of the Bible (the Peshito<note place='foot'><emph>Peshito</emph>
means simple. The Old Testament was translated from Hebrew,
the New Testament from Greek, about 200, if not earlier. Ephraem
Syrus lived in the middle of the fourth century. During the eighth and
ninth centuries the Nestorians of Syria acted as the instructors of the
Arabs. Their literary and intellectual supremacy began to fail in the
tenth century. It was revived for a time by Gregorius Barhebræus
(Abulfaraj) in the thirteenth century. See Renan, p. 257.</note>) ascribed to
the second century, and in the rich Christian literature
dating from the fourth. It is still spoken, though in a
very corrupt form, by the Nestorians of Kurdistan, near
the lakes of Van and Urmia, and by some Christian
tribes in Mesopotamia; and an attempt has been made
by the American missionaries,<note place='foot'>Messrs. Perkins
and Stoddard, the latter the author of a grammar, published
in the Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. v. 1.</note> stationed at Urmia, to
restore this dialect to some grammatical correctness by
publishing translations and a grammar of what they call
the Neo-Syriac language.
</p>

<p>
The name of <emph>Chaldee</emph> has been given to the language
adopted by the Jews during the Babylonian captivity.
Though the Jews always retained a knowledge of their
sacred language, they soon began to adopt the dialect
of their conquerors, not for conversation only, but also
for literary composition.<note place='foot'>Renan,
p. 214 <hi rend='italic'>seq.</hi>, <q>Le chaldéen biblique serait un dialecte araméen

fragments in Chaldee, contemporaneous with the cuneiform
inscriptions of Darius and Xerxes, and several of

of the Aramaic, or the language of Babylonia, as transplanted
to Palestine. This Aramaic was the dialect

words preserved in the New Testament as spoken

Jews.<note place='foot'>Renan, pp. 220-222.</note>

After the destruction of Jerusalem the literature of
the Jews continued to be written in the same dialect.
The Talmud<note place='foot'><hi rend='italic'>Talmud</hi>
(instruction) consists of <hi rend='italic'>Mishna</hi> and
<hi rend='italic'>Gemara</hi>. <hi rend='italic'>Mishna</hi> means

of Babylon of the fifth, century exhibit the Aramean,
as spoken by the educated Jews settled in these two
localities, though greatly depraved and spoiled by an admixture
of strange elements. This language remained
the literary idiom of the Jews to the tenth century.
The <hi rend='italic'>Masora</hi>,<note place='foot'>First printed
in the Rabbinic Bible, Venice, 1525.</note> and the traditional commentary of the Old
Testament, was written in it about that time. Soon
after the Jews adopted Arabic as their literary language,
and retained it to the thirteenth century. They
then returned to a kind of modernized Hebrew, which
they still continue to employ for learned discussions.
</p>

<pb n='278'/><anchor id='Pg278'/>

<p>
It is curious that the Aramaic branch of the Semitic
family, though originally the language of the great
kingdoms of Babylon and Nineveh, should have been
preserved to us only in the literature of the Jews, and
of the Christians of Syria. There must have been a
Babylonian literature, for the wisdom of the Chaldeans
had acquired a reputation which could hardly have
been sustained without a literature. Abraham must
have spoken Aramaic before he emigrated to Canaan.
Laban spoke the same dialect, and the name which he
gave to the heap of stones that was to be a witness
between him and Jacob, (Jegar-sahadutha) is Syriac,
whereas Galeed, the name by which Jacob called it,
is Hebrew.<note place='foot'>Quatremère, Mémoire
sur les Nabatéens, p. 139.</note> If we are ever to recover a knowledge
of that ancient Babylonian literature, it must
be from the cuneiform inscriptions lately brought home
from Babylon and Nineveh. They are clearly written
in a Semitic language. About this there can
be no longer any doubt. And though the progress
in deciphering them has been slow, and slower than
was at one time expected, yet there is no reason to
despair. In a letter, dated April, 1853, Sir Henry
Rawlinson wrote:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>On the clay tablets which we have found at Nineveh,
and which now are to be counted by thousands,
there are explanatory treatises on almost every subject
under the sun: the art of writing, grammars, and dictionaries,
notation, weights and measures, divisions of
time, chronology, astronomy, geography, history, mythology,
geology, botany, &amp;c. In fact we have now at
our disposal a perfect cyclopædia of Assyrian science.</q>
Considering what has been achieved in deciphering one
<pb n='279'/><anchor id='Pg279'/>
class of cuneiform inscriptions, the Persian, there is no
reason to doubt that the whole of that cyclopædia will
some day be read with the same ease with which we
read the mountain records of Darius.
</p>

<p>
There is, however, another miserable remnant of
what was once the literature of the Chaldeans or
Babylonians, namely, the <q>Book of Adam,</q> and similar
works preserved by the <hi rend='italic'>Mendaïtes</hi>
or <hi rend='italic'>Nasoreans</hi>, a curious
sect settled near Bassora. Though the composition
of these works is as late as the tenth century after
Christ, it has been supposed that under a modern crust
of wild and senseless hallucinations, they contain some
grains of genuine ancient Babylonian thought. These
<hi rend='italic'>Mendaïtes</hi> have in
fact been identified with the <hi rend='italic'>Nabateans</hi>,
who are mentioned as late as the tenth century<note place='foot'>Renan, p. 241.</note>
of our era, as a race purely pagan, and distinct from
Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans. In Arabic the
name Nabatean<note place='foot'>Ibid. p. 237.</note> is used for Babylonians,&mdash;nay,
all the people of Aramaic origin, settled in the earliest

have lately seen in some literary journals an account
of a work called <q>The Nabatean Agriculture.</q> It

traditions, which may go back to the days of the great
Babylonian monarchs, these traditions can hardly be
taken as a fair representation of the ancient civilization
of the Aramean race.
</p>

<p>
The second branch of the Semitic family is the <emph>Hebraic</emph>,
chiefly represented by the ancient language of
Palestine, where Hebrew was spoken and written from
the days of Moses to the times of Nehemiah and the
Maccabees, though of course with considerable modifications,
and with a strong admixture of Aramean
forms, particularly since the Babylonian captivity, and
the rise of a powerful civilization in the neighboring
country of Syria. The ancient language of Phœnicia,
to judge from inscriptions, was most closely allied to
Hebrew, and the language of the Carthaginians too
must be referred to the same branch.
</p>

<p>
Hebrew was first encroached upon by Aramaic dialects,
through the political ascendency of Babylon, and
<pb n='281'/><anchor id='Pg281'/>
still more of Syria; and was at last swept away by
Arabic, which, since the conquest of Palestine and
Syria in the year 636, has monopolized nearly the
whole area formerly occupied by the two older branches
of the Semitic stock, the Aramaic and Hebrew.
</p>

<p>
This third, or Arabic, branch sprang from the Arabian
peninsula, where it is still spoken by a compact
mass of aboriginal inhabitants. Its most ancient documents
are the <emph>Himyaritic</emph> inscriptions. In very early
times this Arabic branch was transplanted to Africa,
where, south of Egypt and Nubia, on the coast opposite
Yemen, an ancient Semitic dialect has maintained
itself to the present day. This is the <emph>Ethiopic</emph> or <emph>Abyssinian</emph>,
or, as it is called by the people themselves, the
<emph>Gees</emph> language. Though no longer spoken in its purity
by the people of Habesh, it is still preserved in their
sacred writings, translations of the Bible, and similar
works, which date from the third and fourth centuries.
The modern language of Abyssinia is called <emph>Amharic</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The earliest literary documents of Arabic go back
beyond Mohammed. They are called <emph>Moallakat</emph>, literally,
suspended poems, because they are said to have
been thus publicly exhibited at Mecca. They are old
popular poems, descriptive of desert life. With Mohammed
Arabic became the language of a victorious
religion, and established its sway over Asia, Africa,
and Europe.
</p>

<p>
These three branches, the Aramaic, the Hebraic,
and Arabic, are so closely related to each other, that
it was impossible not to recognize their common origin.
Every root in these languages, as far back as we know
them, must consist of three consonants, and numerous
<pb n='282'/><anchor id='Pg282'/>
words are derived from these roots by a simple change
of vowels, leaving the consonantal skeleton as much
as possible intact. It is impossible to mistake a Semitic
language; and what is most important&mdash;it is
impossible to imagine an Aryan language derived
from a Semitic, or a Semitic from an Aryan language.
The grammatical framework is totally distinct in these
two families of speech. This does not exclude, however,
the possibility that both are diverging streams of
the same source; and the comparisons that have been
instituted between the Semitic roots, reduced to their
simplest form, and the roots of the Aryan languages,
have made it more than probable that the material elements
with which they both started were originally the
same.
</p>

<p>
Other languages which are supposed to belong to the
Semitic family are the <emph>Berber</emph> dialects of Northern
Africa, spoken on the coast from Egypt to the Atlantic
Ocean before the invasion of the Arabs, and now
pushed back towards the interior. Some other African
languages, too, such as the <emph>Haussa</emph> and <emph>Galla</emph>, have
been classed as Semitic; and the language of Egypt,
from the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions to the Coptic,
which ceased to be spoken after the seventeenth century,
has equally been referred to this class. The
Semitic character of these dialects, however, is much
less clearly defined, and the exact degree of relationship
in which they stand to the Semitic languages,
properly so-called, has still to be determined.
</p>

<p>
Strictly speaking the Aryan and Semitic are the
only <emph>families</emph> of speech which fully deserve that title.
They both presuppose the existence of a finished system
of grammar, previous to the first divergence of
<pb n='283'/><anchor id='Pg283'/>
their dialects. Their history is from the beginning a
history of decay rather than of growth, and hence the
unmistakable family-likeness which pervades every one
even of their latest descendants. The language of the
Sepoy and that of the English soldier are, strictly
speaking, one and the same language. They are both
built up of materials which were definitely shaped before
the Teutonic and Indic branches separated. No
new root has been added to either since their first separation;
and the grammatical forms which are of more
modern growth in English or Hindustání, are, if closely
examined, new combinations only of elements which
existed from the beginning in all the Aryan dialects.
In the termination of the English <emph>he is</emph>, and in the inaudible
termination of the French <emph>il est</emph>, we recognize
the result of an act performed before the first separation
of the Aryan family, the combination of the predicative
root <emph>as</emph> with the demonstrative root <emph>ti</emph>; an act
performed once for all, and continuing to be felt to the
present day.
</p>

<p>
It was the custom of Nebuchadnezzar to have his
name stamped on every brick that was used during
his reign in erecting his colossal palaces. Those palaces
fell to ruins, but from the ruins the ancient materials
were carried away for building new cities; and on
examining the bricks in the walls of the modern city
of Baghdad on the borders of the Tigris, Sir Henry
Rawlinson discovered on each the clear traces of that
royal signature. It is the same if we examine the
structure of modern languages. They too were built
up with the materials taken from the ruins of the ancient
languages, and every word, if properly examined,
displays the visible stamp impressed upon it from the
<pb n='284'/><anchor id='Pg284'/>
first by the founders of the Aryan and the Semitic
empires of speech.
</p>

<p>
The relationship of languages, however, is not always
so close. Languages may diverge before their
grammatical system has become fixed and hardened;
and in that case they cannot be expected to show the
same marked features of a common descent as, for
instance, the Neo-Latin dialects, French, Italian, and
Spanish. They may have much in common, but they
will likewise display an after-growth in words and
grammatical forms peculiar to each dialect. With regard
to words we see that even languages so intimately
related to each other as the six Romance dialects,
diverged in some of the commonest expressions. Instead
of the Latin <emph>frater</emph>, the French <emph>frère</emph>, we find in
Spanish <emph>hermano</emph>. There was a very good reason for
this change. The Latin word <emph>frater</emph>, changed into
<emph>fray</emph> and <emph>frayle</emph>, had been applied to express a brother
or a friar. It was felt inconvenient that the same word
should express two ideas which it was sometimes necessary
to distinguish, and therefore, by a kind of natural
elimination, <emph>frater</emph> was given up as the name of brother
in Spanish, and replaced from the dialectical stores of
Latin, by <emph>germanus</emph>. In the same manner the Latin
word for shepherd, <emph>pastor</emph>, was so constantly applied to
the shepherd of the people or the clergyman, <emph>le pasteur</emph>,
that a new word was wanted for the real shepherd. Thus
<emph>berbicarius</emph> from <emph>berbex</emph> or <emph>vervex</emph>, a wether, was
used instead of <emph>pastor</emph>, and changed into the French
<emph>berger</emph>. Instead of the Spanish <emph>enfermo</emph>, ill, we find in
French <emph>malade</emph>, in Italian <emph>malato</emph>. Languages so intimately
related as Greek and Latin have fixed on different
expressions for son, daughter, brother, woman,
<pb n='285'/><anchor id='Pg285'/>
man, sky, earth, moon, hand, mouth, tree, bird,
&amp;c.<note place='foot'>See Letter on Turanian Languages, p. 62.</note>
That is to say, out of a large number of synonymes
which were supplied by the numerous dialects of the
Aryan family, the Greeks perpetuated one, the Romans
another. It is clear that when the working of
this principle of natural selection is allowed to extend
more widely, languages, though proceeding from the
same source, may in time acquire a totally different
nomenclature for the commonest objects. The number
of real synonymes is frequently exaggerated, and
if we are told that in Icelandic there are 120 names for
island, or in Arabic 500 names for lion,<note place='foot'>Renan,
Histoire des Langues sémitiques, p. 137.</note> and 1,000
names for sword,<note place='foot'>Pococke, Notes to
Abulfaragius, p. 153; Glossology, p. 352.</note> many of these are no doubt purely
poetical. But even where there are in a language only
four or five names for the same objects, it is clear that
four languages might be derived from it, each in appearance
quite distinct from the rest.
</p>

<p>
The same applies to grammar. When the Romance
languages, for instance, formed their new future by
placing the auxiliary verb <emph>habere</emph>, to have, after the
infinitive, it was quite open to any one of them to fix
upon some other expedient for expressing the future.
The French might have chosen <emph>je vais dire</emph> or <emph>je dirvais</emph>
(I wade to say) instead of <emph>je dirai</emph>, and in this
case the future in French would have been totally distinct
from the future in Italian. If such changes are
possible in literary languages of such long standing as
French and Italian, we must be prepared for a great
deal more in languages which, as I said, diverged before
any definite settlement had taken place either in their
<pb n='286'/><anchor id='Pg286'/>
grammar or their dictionary. If we were to expect in
them the definite criteria of a genealogical relationship
which unites the members of the Aryan and Semitic
families of speech, we should necessarily be disappointed.
Such criteria could not possibly exist in these
languages. But there are criteria for determining even
these more distant degrees of relationship in the vast
realm of speech; and they are sufficient at least to arrest
the hasty conclusions of those who would deny the
possibility of a common origin of any languages more
removed from each other than French and Italian,
Sanskrit and Greek, Hebrew and Arabic. You will
see this more clearly after we have examined the principles
of what I call the <emph>morphological classification</emph> of
human speech.
</p>

<p>
As all languages, so far as we can judge at present,
can be reduced in the end to roots, predicative and
demonstrative, it is clear that, according to the manner
in which roots are put together, we may expect
to find three kinds of languages, or three stages in the
gradual formation of speech.
</p>

<p>
1. Roots may be used as words, each root preserving
its full independence.
</p>

<p>
2. Two roots may be joined together to form words,
and in these compounds one root may lose its independence.
</p>

<p>
3. Two roots may be joined together to form words,
and in these compounds both roots may lose their independence.
</p>

<p>
What applies to two roots, applies to three or four
or more. The principle is the same, though it would
lead to a more varied subdivision.
</p>

<p>
The first stage, in which each root preserves its independence,
<pb n='287'/><anchor id='Pg287'/>
and in which there is no formal distinction
between a root and a word, I call the <emph>Radical Stage</emph>.
This stage is best represented by ancient Chinese.
Languages belonging to this first or Radical Stage,
have sometimes been called <emph>Monosyllabic</emph> or <emph>Isolating</emph>.
The second stage, in which two or more roots coalesce
to form a word, the one retaining its radical independence,
the other sinking down to a mere termination,
I call the <emph>Terminational Stage</emph>. This stage is best
represented by the Turanian family of speech, and the
languages belonging to it have generally been called
<emph>agglutinative</emph>, from <emph>gluten</emph>, glue. The third stage, in
which roots coalesce so that neither the one nor the
other retains its substantive independence, I call the
<emph>Inflectional Stage</emph>. This stage is best represented by
the Aryan and Semitic families, and the languages
belonging to it have sometimes been distinguished by
the name of <emph>organic</emph> or <emph>amalgamating</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The first stage excludes phonetic corruption altogether.
</p>

<p>
The second stage excludes phonetic corruption in
the principal root, but allows it in the secondary or
determinative elements.
</p>

<p>
The third stage allows phonetic corruption both in
the principal root and in the terminations.
</p>

<p>
A few instances will make this classification clearer.
</p>

<p>
In the first stage, which is represented by Chinese,
every word is a root, and has its own substantial meaning.
Thus, where we say in Latin <emph>baculo</emph>, with a stick,
we say in Chinese <emph>ỳ ćáng</emph>.<note place='foot'>Endlicher,
Chinesische Grammatik, p. 223.</note> Here <emph>ỳ</emph> might be taken
for a mere preposition, like the English <emph>with</emph>. But in
Chinese this <emph>ỳ</emph> is a root; it is the same word which,
<pb n='288'/><anchor id='Pg288'/>
if used as a verb, would mean <q>to employ.</q> Therefore
in Chinese <emph>ỳ ćáng</emph> means literally <q>employ stick.</q>
Or again, where we say in English <emph>at home</emph>, or in Latin
<emph>domi</emph>, the Chinese say <emph>ŭŏ-li, ŭŏ</emph> meaning <emph>house</emph>,
and <emph>li</emph> originally <emph>inside</emph>.<note place='foot'>Endlicher,
Chinesische Grammatik, p. 339.</note> The name for <emph>day</emph> in Chinese
is <emph>ģi-tse</emph>, which means originally <emph>son of the
sun</emph>.<note place='foot'><q>In this word <emph>tse</emph>
(tseu) does not signify son; it is an addition of frequent
occurrence after nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Thus, <emph>lao</emph>,
old, + <emph>tseu</emph> is father; <emph>neï</emph>, the interior, +
<emph>tseu</emph> is wife; <emph>hiang</emph>, scent, + <emph>tseu</emph> is
clove; <emph>hoa</emph>, to beg, + <emph>tseu</emph>, a mendicant;
<emph>hi</emph>, to act, + <emph>tseu</emph>, an
actor.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Stanislas Julien</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
There is in Chinese, as we saw before, no formal
distinction between a noun, a verb, an adjective, an
adverb, a preposition. The same root, according to
its position in a sentence, may be employed to convey
the meaning of great, greatness, greatly, and to be
great. Everything in fact depends in Chinese on the
proper collocation of words in a sentence. Thus <emph>ngò
tà ni</emph> means <q>I beat thee;</q> but <emph>ni tà ngò</emph> would mean
<q>Thou beatest me.</q> Thus <emph>ngŏ ģin</emph> means <q>a bad
man;</q> <emph>ģin ngŏ</emph> would mean <q>the man is bad.</q>
</p>

<p>
As long as every word, or part of a word, is felt to
express its own radical meaning, a language belongs
to the first or radical stage. As soon as such words
as <emph>tse</emph> in <emph>ģi-tse</emph>, day, <emph>li</emph>
in <emph>ŭŏ-li</emph>, at home, or <emph>ỳ</emph> in <emph>ỳ-ćáng</emph>,
with the stick, lose their etymological meaning and
become mere signs of derivation or of case, language
enters into the second or <emph>Terminational</emph> stage.
</p>

<p>
By far the largest number of languages belong to
this stage. The whole of what is called the <emph>Turanian</emph>
family of speech consists of Terminational or Agglutinative
languages, and this Turanian family comprises
in reality all languages spoken in Asia and Europe,
and not included under the Aryan and Semitic families,
<pb n='289'/><anchor id='Pg289'/>
with the exception of Chinese and its cognate
dialects. In the great continent of the Old World
the Semitic and Aryan languages occupy only what
may be called the four western peninsulas, namely,
India with Persia, Arabia, Asia Minor, and Europe;
and we have reason to suppose that even these countries
were held by Turanian tribes previous to the
arrival of the Aryan and Semitic nations.
</p>

<p>
This Turanian family is of great importance in the
science of languages. Some scholars would deny it
the name of a family; and if family is only applicable
to dialects so closely connected among themselves as
the Aryan or Semitic, it would no doubt be preferable
to speak of the Turanian as a class or group, and not
as a family of languages. But this concession must
not be understood as an admission that the members
of this class start from different sources, and that
they are held together, not by genealogical affinity,
but by morphological similarity only.
</p>

<p>
These languages share elements in common which
they must have borrowed from the same source, and
their formal coincidences, though of a different character
from those of the Aryan and Semitic families,
are such that it would be impossible to ascribe them
to mere accident.
</p>

<p>
The name Turanian is used in opposition to Aryan,
and is applied to the nomadic races of Asia as opposed
to the agricultural or Aryan races.
</p>

<p>
The Turanian family or class consists of two great
divisions, the <emph>Northern</emph> and the <emph>Southern</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The Northern is sometimes called the <emph>Ural-Altaic</emph> or
<emph>Ugro-Tataric</emph>, and it is divided into five sections, the
<emph>Tungusic</emph>, <emph>Mongolic</emph>, <emph>Turkic</emph>,
<emph>Finnic</emph>, and <emph>Samoyedic</emph>.
</p>

<pb n='290'/><anchor id='Pg290'/>

<p>
The Southern, which occupies the south of Asia, is
divided into four classes, the <emph>Tamulic</emph>, or the languages
of the Dekhan; the <emph>Bhotîya</emph>, or the dialects of Tibet
and Bhotan; the <emph>Taïc</emph>, or the dialects of Siam,
and the <emph>Malaic</emph>, or the Malay and Polynesian dialects.
</p>

<p>
No doubt if we expected to find in this immense
number of languages the same family likeness which
holds the Semitic or Aryan languages together, we
should be disappointed. But the very absence of that
family likeness constitutes one of the distinguishing
features of the Turanian dialects. They are <emph>Nomad</emph>
languages, as contrasted with the Aryan, and Semitic
languages.<note place='foot'>Letter on the
Turanian Languages, p. 24.</note> In the latter most words and grammatical
forms were thrown out but once by the creative
power of one generation, and they were not lightly
parted with, even though their original distinctness
had been blurred by phonetic corruption. To hand
down a language in this manner is possible only among
people whose history runs on in one main stream; and
where religion, law, and poetry supply well-defined borders
which hem in on every side the current of language.
Among the Turanian nomads no such nucleus
of a political, social, or literary character has ever been
formed. Empires were no sooner founded than they
were scattered again like the sand-clouds of the desert;
no laws, no songs, no stories outlived the age of their
authors. How quickly language can change, if thus
left to itself without any literary standard, we saw in
a former Lecture, when treating of the growth of dialects.
The most necessary substantives, such as father,
mother, daughter, son, have frequently been lost and
<pb n='291'/><anchor id='Pg291'/>
replaced by synonymes in the different dialects of Turanian
speech, and the grammatical terminations have
been treated with the same freedom. Nevertheless,
some of the Turanian numerals and pronouns, and
many Turanian roots, point to a single original source;
and the common words and common roots, which have
been discovered in the most distant branches of the
Turanian stock, warrant the admission of a real, though
very distant, genealogical relationship of all Turanian
speech.
</p>

<p>
The most characteristic feature of the Turanian languages
is what has been called <emph>Agglutination</emph>, or <q>gluing
together.</q><note place='foot'>Survey of
Languages, p. 90.</note> This means not only that, in their
grammar, pronouns are <emph>glued</emph> to the verbs in order to
form the conjugation, or prepositions to substantives in
order to form declension. <emph>That</emph> would not be a distinguishing
characteristic of the Turanian or nomad languages;
for in Hebrew as well as in Sanskrit, conjugation
and declension were originally formed on the same
principle. What distinguishes the Turanian languages
is, that in them the conjugation and declension can still
be taken to pieces; and although the terminations have
by no means always retained their significative power
as independent words, they are felt as modificatory syllables,
and as distinct from the roots to which they are
appended.
</p>

<p>
In the Aryan languages the modifications of words,
comprised under declension and conjugation, were likewise
originally expressed by agglutination. But the
component parts began soon to coalesce, so as to form
one integral word, liable in its turn to phonetic corruption
to such an extent that it became impossible after a
<pb n='292'/><anchor id='Pg292'/>
time to decide which was the root and which the modificatory
element. The difference between an Aryan and
a Turanian language is somewhat the same as between
good and bad mosaic. The Aryan words seem made of
one piece, the Turanian words clearly show the sutures
and fissures where the small stones are cemented
together.
</p>

<p>
There was a very good reason why the Turanian
languages should have remained in this second or
agglutinative stage. It was felt essential that the radical
portion of each word should stand out in distinct relief,
and never be obscured or absorbed, as happens in the
third or inflectional stage.
</p>

<p>
The French <emph>âge</emph>, for instance, has lost its whole material
body, and is nothing but termination. <emph>Age</emph> in
old French was <emph>eage</emph> and <emph>edage</emph>. <emph>Edage</emph> is a
corruption of the Latin <emph>œtaticum</emph>; <emph>œtaticum</emph> is a derivative of
<emph>œtas</emph>; <emph>œtas</emph> an abbreviation of <emph>œvitas</emph>;
<emph>œvitas</emph> is derived
from <emph>œvum</emph>, and in <emph>œvum</emph>, <emph>œ</emph> only is the radical
or predicative element, the Sanskrit <emph>ây</emph> in <emph>ây-us</emph>, life,
which contains the germ from which these various
words derive their life and meaning. From <emph>œvum</emph>
the Romans derived <emph>œviternus</emph>, contracted into <emph>œternus</emph>,
so that <emph>age</emph> and <emph>eternity</emph> flow from the same
source. What trace of <emph>œ</emph> or <emph>œvum</emph>, or even <emph>œvitas</emph>
and <emph>œtas</emph>, remains in <emph>âge</emph>? Turanian languages cannot
afford such words as <emph>âge</emph> in their dictionaries. It
is an indispensable requirement in a nomadic language
that it should be intelligible to many, though
their intercourse be but scanty. It requires tradition,
society, and literature, to maintain words and
forms which can no longer be analyzed at once. Such
words would seldom spring up in nomadic languages,
<pb n='293'/><anchor id='Pg293'/>
or if they did, they would die away with each generation.
</p>

<p>
The Aryan verb contains many forms in which the
personal pronoun is no longer felt distinctly. And yet
tradition, custom, and law preserve the life of these
veterans, and make us feel unwilling to part with them.
But in the ever-shifting state of a nomadic society no
debased coin can be tolerated in language, no obscure
legend accepted on trust. The metal must be pure,
and the legend distinct; that the one may be weighed,
and the other, if not deciphered, at least recognized as
a well-known guarantee. Hence the small proportion
of irregular forms in all agglutinative languages.<note place='foot'>The Abbé
Molina states that the language of Chili is entirely free
from irregular forms. Du Ponceau, Mémoire, p. 90.</note>
</p>

<p>
A Turanian might tolerate the Sanskrit,
</p>

<lg>
<l>as-mi,  a-si,      as-ti,   's-mas,   's-tha,    's-anti,</l>
<l>I am,   thou art,  he is,   we are,   you are,   they are;</l>
</lg>

<p>
or even the Latin,
</p>

<lg>
<l>'s-um,  e-s,       es-t,   'su-mus,   es-tis,    'sunt.</l>
</lg>

<p>
In these instances, with a few exceptions, root and
affix are as distinguishable as, for instance, in Turkish:
</p>

<lg>
<l>bakar-im,     bakar-sin,         bakar,</l>
<l>I regard,     thou regardest,    he regards.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>bakar-iz,     bakar-siniz,       bakar-lar</l>
<l>we regard,    you regard,        they regard.</l>
</lg>

<p>
But a conjugation like the Hindustání, which is a modern
Aryan dialect,
</p>

<lg>
<l>hun, hai, hai, hain, ho, hain,</l>
</lg>

<p>
would not be compatible with the genius of the Turanian
languages, because it would not answer the
requirements of a nomadic life. Turanian dialects
<pb n='294'/><anchor id='Pg294'/>
exhibit either no terminational distinctions at all, as
in Mandshu, which is a Tungusic dialect; or a complete
and intelligible system of affixes, as in the spoken
dialect of Nyertchinsk, equally of Tungusic descent.
But a state of conjugation in which, through phonetic
corruption, the suffix of the first person singular and
plural, and of the third person plural are the same,
where there is no distinction between the second and
third persons singular, and between the first and third
persons plural, would necessarily lead, in a Turanian
dialect, to the adoption of new and more expressive
forms. New pronouns would have to be used to mark
the persons, or some other expedient be resorted to for
the same purpose.
</p>

<p>
And this will make it still more clear why the
Turanian languages, or in fact all languages in this
second or agglutinative stage, though protected against
phonetic corruption more than the Aryan and Semitic
languages, are so much exposed to the changes produced
by dialectical regeneration. A Turanian retains,
as it were, the consciousness of his language and
grammar. The idea, for instance, which he connects
with a plural is that of a noun followed by a syllable
indicative of plurality; a passive with him is a verb
followed by a syllable expressive of suffering, or eating,
or going.<note place='foot'>Letter on
Turanian Languages, p. 206.</note> Now these determinative ideas may be
expressed in various ways, and though in one and the
same clan, and during one period of time, a certain
number of terminations would become stationary, and
be assigned to the expression of certain grammatical
categories, such as the plural, the passive, the genitive,
different hordes, as they separated, would still feel
<pb n='295'/><anchor id='Pg295'/>
themselves at liberty to repeat the process of grammatical
composition, and defy the comparative grammarian
to prove the identity of the terminations, even
in dialects so closely allied as Finnish and Hungarian,
or Tamil and Telugu.
</p>

<p>
It must not be supposed, however, that Turanian or
agglutinative languages are forever passing through
this process of grammatical regeneration. Where nomadic
tribes approach to a political organization, their
language, though Turanian, may approach to the system
of political or traditional languages, such as Sanskrit
or Hebrew. This is indeed the case with the most
advanced members of the Turanian family, the Hungarian,
the Finnish, the Tamil, Telugu, &amp;c. Many
of their grammatical terminations have suffered by
phonetic corruption, but they have not been replaced
by new and more expressive words. The termination
of the plural is <emph>lu</emph> in Telugu, and this is probably a
mere corruption of <emph>gaḷ.</emph>, the termination of the plural
in Tamil. The only characteristic Turanian feature
which always remains is this: the root is never obscured.
Besides this, the determining or modifying
syllables are generally placed at the end, and the
vowels do not become so absolutely fixed for each
syllable as in Sanskrit or Hebrew. On the contrary,
there is what is called the Law of Harmony, according
to which the vowels of each word may be changed and
modulated so as to harmonize with the key-note struck
by its chief vowel. The vowels in Turkish, for instance,
are divided into two classes, <emph>sharp</emph> and <emph>flat</emph>. If
a verb contains a sharp vowel in its radical portion,
the vowels of the terminations are all sharp, while
the same terminations, if following a root with a
<pb n='296'/><anchor id='Pg296'/>
flat vowel, modulate their own vowels into the flat
key. Thus we have <emph>sev-mek</emph>, to love, but <emph>bak-mak</emph>,
to regard, <emph>mek</emph> or <emph>mak</emph> being the termination of the
infinitive. Thus we say, <emph>ev-ler</emph>, the houses, but <emph>at-lar</emph>,
the horses, <emph>ler</emph> or <emph>lar</emph> being the termination of the plural.
</p>

<p>
No Aryan or Semitic language has preserved a similar
freedom in the harmonic arrangement of its vowels,
while traces of it have been found among the most distant
members of the Turanian family, as in Hungarian,
Mongolian, Turkish, the Yakut, spoken in the
north of Siberia, and in dialects spoken on the eastern
frontiers of India.
</p>

<p>
For completeness' sake I add a short account of the
Turanian family, chiefly taken from my Survey of
Languages, published 1855:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Tungusic Class.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The <emph>Tungusic</emph> branch extends from China northward
to Siberia and westward to 113°, where the
river Tunguska partly marks its frontier. The Tungusic
tribes in Siberia are under Russian sway.
Other Tungusic tribes belong to the Chinese empire,
and are known by the name of Mandshu, a name
taken after they had conquered China in 1644, and
founded the present imperial dynasty.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Mongolic Class.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The original seats of the people who speak Mongolic
dialects lie near the Lake Baikal and in the
eastern parts of Siberia, where we find them as early
as the ninth century after Christ. They were divided
into three classes, the <emph>Mongols</emph> proper, the <emph>Buriäts</emph>, and
the <emph>Ölöts</emph> or <emph>Kalmüks</emph>. Chingis-khán (1227) united
<pb n='297'/><anchor id='Pg297'/>
them into a nation and founded the Mongolian empire,
which included, however, not only Mongolic, but
Tungusic and Turkic, commonly called Tataric, tribes.
</p>

<p>
The name of Tatar soon became the terror of Asia
and Europe, and it was applied promiscuously to all
the nomadic warriors whom Asia then poured forth
over Europe. Originally Tatar was a name of the
Mongolic races, but through their political ascendency
in Asia after Chingis-khán, it became usual to call
all the tribes which were under Mongolian sway by
the name of Tatar. In linguistic works Tataric is
now used in two several senses. Following the example
of writers of the Middle Ages, Tataric, like
Scythian in Greek, has been fixed upon as the general
term comprising <emph>all</emph> languages spoken by the nomadic
tribes of Asia. Hence it is used sometimes in the
same sense in which we use Turanian. Secondly,
Tataric has become the name of that class of Turanian
languages of which the Turkish is the most
prominent member. While the Mongolic class&mdash;that
which in fact has the greatest claims to the name of
Tataric&mdash;is never so called, it has become an almost
universal custom to apply this name to the third or
Turkic branch of the Ural-Altaic division; and the
races belonging to this branch have in many instances
themselves adopted the name. These Turkish, or as
they are more commonly called, Tataric races, were
settled on the northern side of the Caspian Sea, and
on the Black Sea, and were known as Komanes,
Pechenegs, and Bulgars, when conquered by the
Mongolic army of the son of Chingis-khán, who
founded the Kapchakian empire, extending from the
Dniestr to the Yemba and the Kirgisian steppes.
Russia for two centuries was under the sway of these
<pb n='298'/><anchor id='Pg298'/>
Kháns, known as the Khans of the Golden Horde.
This empire was dissolved towards the end of the
fifteenth century, and several smaller kingdoms rose
out of its ruins. Among these Krim, Kasan, and
Astrachan, were the most important. The princes
of these kingdoms still gloried in their descent from
Chingis-khán, and had hence a right to the name of
Mongols or Tatars. But their armies and subjects
also, who were of Turkish blood, received the name
of their princes; and their languages continued to be
called Tataric, even after the tribes by whom they
were spoken had been brought under the Russian
sceptre, and were no longer governed by khans of
Mongolic or Tataric origin. It would perhaps be desirable
to use Turkic instead of Tataric, when speaking
of the third branch of the northern division of the
Turanian family, did not a change of terminology
generally produce as much confusion as it remedies.
The recollection of their non-Tataric, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> non-Mongolic
origin, remains, it appears, among the so-called
Tatars of Kasan and Astrachan. If asked whether
they are Tatars, they reply no; and they call their
language Turki or Turuk, but not Tatari. Nay, they
consider Tatar as a term of abuse, synonymous with
robber, evidently from a recollection that their ancestors
had once been conquered and enslaved by Mongolic,
that is, Tataric, tribes. All this rests on the
authority of Klaproth, who during his stay in Russia
had great opportunities of studying the languages spoken
on the frontiers of this half-Asiatic empire.
</p>

<p>
The conquests of the Mongols or the descendants of
Chingis-khán were not confined, however, to these
Turkish tribes. They conquered China in the east,
where they founded the Mongolic dynasty of Yuan,
<pb n='299'/><anchor id='Pg299'/>
and in the west, after subduing the khalifs of Bagdad,
and the Sultans of Iconium, they conquered Moscow,
and devastated the greater part of Russia. In 1240
they invaded Poland, in 1241 Silesia. Here they
recoiled before the united armies of Germany, Poland,
and Silesia. They retired into Moravia, and having
exhausted that country, occupied Hungary. At that
time they had to choose a new khan, which could
only be done at Karakorum, the old capital of their
empire. Thither they withdrew to elect an emperor
to govern an empire which then extended from China
to Poland, from India to Siberia. But a realm of such
vast proportions could not be long held together, and
towards the end of the thirteenth century it broke up
into several independent states, all under Mongolian
princes, but no longer under one khan of khans. Thus
new independent Mongolic empires arose in China,
Turkestan, Siberia, Southern Russia, and Persia. In
1360, the Mongolian dynasty was driven out of China;
in the fifteenth century they lost their hold on Russia.
In Central Asia they rallied once more under Timur
(1369), whose sway was again acknowledged from
Karakorum to Persia and Anatolia. But in 1468, this
empire also fell by its own weight, and for want of
powerful rulers like Chingis-khán or Timur. In Jagatai
alone, the country extending from the Aral Lake
to the Hindu-kush, between the rivers Oxus and
Yaxartes (Jihon and Sihon), and once governed by
Jagatai, the son of Chingis-khán&mdash;the Mongolian dynasty
maintained itself, and thence it was that Baber,
a descendant of Timur, conquered India, and founded
there a Mongolian dynasty, surviving up to our
own times in the Great Moguls of Delhi. Most
Mongolic tribes are now under the sway of the nations
<pb n='300'/><anchor id='Pg300'/>
whom they once had conquered, the Tungusic
sovereigns of China, the Russian czars, and the Turkish
sultans.
</p>

<p>
The Mongolic language, although spoken (but not
continuously) from China as far as the Volga, has
given rise to but few dialects. Next to Tungusic,
the Mongolic is the poorest language of the Turanian
family, and the scantiness of grammatical terminations
accounts for the fact that, as a language, it has remained
very much unchanged. There is, however, a
distinction between the language as spoken by the
Eastern, Western, and Northern tribes, and incipient
traces of grammatical life have lately been discovered
by Castrén, the great Swedish traveller and Turanian
philologist, in the spoken dialect of the Buriäts. In
it the persons of the verb are distinguished by affixes,
while, according to the rules of Mongolic grammar,
no other dialect distinguishes in the verb between am<emph>o</emph>,
am<emph>as</emph>, am<emph>at</emph>.
</p>

<p>
The Mongols who live in Europe have fixed their
tents on each side of the Volga and along the coast of
the Caspian Sea near Astrachan. Another colony is
found south-east of Sembirsk. They belong to the
Western branch, and are Ölöts or Kalmüks, who left
their seats on the Koko-nur, and entered Europe in
1662. They proceeded from the clans Dürbet and
Torgod, but most of the Torgods returned again in
1770, and their descendants are now scattered over
the Kirgisian steppes.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Turkic Class</hi>.
</p>

<p>
Much more important are the languages belonging
to the third branch of the Turanian family, most
prominent among which is the Turkish or Osmanli of
<pb n='301'/><anchor id='Pg301'/>
Constantinople. The number of the Turkish inhabitants
of European Turkey is indeed small. It is generally
stated at 2,000,000; but Shafarik estimates the
number of genuine Turks at not more than 700,000,
who rule over fifteen millions of people. The different
Turkic dialects of which the Osmanli is one, occupy
one of the largest linguistic areas, extending from the
Lena and the Polar Sea, down to the Adriatic.
</p>

<p>
The most ancient name by which the Turkic tribes
of Central Asia were known to the Chinese was
Hiung-nu. These Hiung-nu founded an empire (206
<hi rend='smallcaps'>b. c.</hi>) comprising a large portion of Asia, west of
China. Engaged in frequent wars with the Chinese,
they were defeated at last in the middle of the first
century after Christ. Thereupon they divided into a
northern and southern empire; and, after the southern
Hiung-nu had become subjects of China, they attacked
the northern Hiung-nu, together with the Chinese,
and, driving them out of their seats between the rivers
Amur and Selenga, and the Altai mountains, westward,
they are supposed to have given the first impulse
to the inroads of the barbarians into Europe. In the
beginning of the third century, the Mongolic and Tungusic
tribes, who had filled the seats of the northern
Hiung-nu, had grown so powerful as to attack the
southern Hiung-nu and drive them from their territories.
This occasioned a second migration of Asiatic
tribes towards the west.
</p>

<p>
Another name by which the Chinese designate these
Hiung-nu or Turkish tribes is Tu-kiu. This Tu-kiu
is supposed to be identical with Turk, and, although
the tribe to which this name was given was originally
but small, it began to spread in the sixth century from
<pb n='302'/><anchor id='Pg302'/>
the Altai to the Caspian, and it was probably to them
that in 569 the Emperor Justinian sent an ambassador
in the person of Semarchos. The empire of the Tu-kiu
was destroyed in the eighth century, by the 'Hui-'he
(Chinese Kao-che). This tribe, equally of Turkish
origin, maintained itself for about a century, and was
then conquered by the Chinese and driven back from
the northern borders of China. Part of the 'Hui-'he
occupied Tangut, and, after a second defeat by the
Mongolians in 1257, the remnant proceeded still further
west, and joined the Uigurs, whose tents were
pitched near the towns of Turfan, 'Kashgar, 'Hamil,
and Aksu.
</p>

<p>
These facts, gleaned chiefly from Chinese historians,
show from the very earliest times the westward tendency
of the Turkish nations. In 568 Turkish tribes
occupied the country between the Volga and the sea
of Azov, and numerous reinforcements have since
strengthened their position in those parts.
</p>

<p>
The northern part of Persia, west of the Caspian
Sea, Armenia, the south of Georgia, Shirwan, and
Dagestan, harbor a Turkic population, known by the
general name of Turkman or Kisil-bash (Red-caps).
They are nomadic robbers, and their arrival in these
countries dates from the eleventh and twelfth centuries.
</p>

<p>
East of the Caspian Sea the Turkman tribes are under
command of the Usbek-Khans of Khiva, Fergana,
and Bukhára. They call themselves, however, not
subjects but guests of these Khans. Still more to the
east the Turkmans are under Chinese sovereignty, and
in the south-west they reach as far as Khorasan and
other provinces of Persia.
</p>

<p>
The Usbeks, descendants of the 'Huy-'he and Uigurs,
<pb n='303'/><anchor id='Pg303'/>
and originally settled in the neighborhood of the towns
of 'Hoten, Kashgar, Turfan, and 'Hamil, crossed the
Yaxartes in the sixteenth century, and after several
successful campaigns gained possession of Balkh, Kharism
(Khiva), Bukhára, and Ferganah. In the latter
country and in Balkh they have become agricultural;
but generally their life is nomadic, and too warlike to
be called pastoral.
</p>

<p>
Another Turkish tribe are the Nogái, west of the
Caspian, and also north of the Black Sea. To the
beginning of the seventeenth century they lived north-east
of the Caspian, and the steppes on the left of the
Irtish bore their name. Pressed by the Kalmüks, a
Mongolic tribe, the Nogáis advanced westward as far
as Astrachan. Peter I. transferred them thence to the
north of the Caucasian mountains, where they still
graze their flocks on the shores of the Kuban and
the Kuma. One horde, that of Kundur, remained on
the Volga, subject to the Kalmüks.
</p>

<p>
Another tribe of Turkish origin in the Caucasus are
the Bazianes. They now live near the sources of the
Kuban, but before the fifteenth century within the
town Majari, on the Kuma.
</p>

<p>
A third Turkish tribe in the Caucasus are the
Kumüks on the rivers Sunja, Aksai, and Koisu: now
subjects of Russia, though under native princes.
</p>

<p>
The southern portion of the Altaic mountains has
long been inhabited by the Bashkirs, a race considerably
mixed with Mongolic blood, savage and ignorant,
subjects of Russia, and Mohammedans by faith. Their
land is divided into four Roads, called the Roads of
Siberia, of Kasan, of Nogai, and of Osa, a place on
the Kama. Among the Bashkirs, and in villages
<pb n='304'/><anchor id='Pg304'/>
near Ufa, is now settled a Turkish tribe, the Mescheräks
who formerly lived near the Volga.
</p>

<p>
The tribes near the Lake of Aral are called Kara-Kalpak.
They are subject partly to Russia, partly to
the Khans of Khiva.
</p>

<p>
The Turks of Siberia, commonly called Tatars, are
partly original settlers, who crossed the Ural, and
founded the Khanat of Sibir, partly later colonists.
Their chief towns are Tobolsk, Yeniseisk, and Tomsk.
Separate tribes are the Uran'hat on the Chulym, and
the Barabas in the steppes between the Irtish and the
Ob.
</p>

<p>
The dialects of these Siberian Turks are considerably
intermingled with foreign words, taken from Mongolic,
Samoyedic, or Russian sources. Still they resemble
one another closely in all that belongs to the
original stock of the language.
</p>

<p>
In the north-east of Asia, on both sides of the river
Lena, the <emph>Yakuts</emph> form the most remote link in the
Turkic chain of languages. Their male population
has lately risen to 100,000, while in 1795 it amounted
only to 50,066. The Russians became first acquainted
with them in 1620. They call themselves Sakha, and
are mostly heathen, though Christianity is gaining
ground among them. According to their traditions,
their ancestors lived for a long time in company with
Mongolic tribes, and traces of this can still be discovered
in their language. Attacked by their neighbors,
they built rafts and floated down the river Lena, where
they settled in the neighborhood of what is now Yakutzk.
Their original seats seem to have been north-west
of Lake Baikal. Their language has preserved
the Turkic type more completely than any other Turco-Tataric
<pb n='305'/><anchor id='Pg305'/>
dialect. Separated from the common stock at
an early time, and removed from the disturbing influences
to which the other dialects were exposed, whether
in war or in peace, the Yakutian has preserved so many
primitive features of Tataric grammar, that even now
it may be used as a key to the grammatical forms of
the Osmanli and other more cultivated Turkic dialects.
</p>

<p>
Southern Siberia is the mother country of the Kirgis,
one of the most numerous tribes of Turco-Tataric
origin. The Kirgis lived originally between the Ob
and Yenisei, where Mongolic tribes settled among them.
At the beginning of the seventeenth century the Russians
became acquainted with the Eastern Kirgis, then
living along the Yenisei. In 1606 they had become
tributary to Russia, and after several wars with two
neighboring tribes, they were driven more and more
south-westward, till they left Siberia altogether at the
beginning of the eighteenth century. They now live
at Burut, in Chinese Turkestan, together with the Kirgis
of the <q>Great Horde,</q> near the town of Kashgar,
north as far as the Irtish.
</p>

<p>
Another tribe is that of the Western Kirgis, or
Kirgis-Kasak, who are partly independent, partly tributary
to Russia and China.
</p>

<p>
Of what are called the three Kirgis Hordes, from
the Caspian Sea east as far as Lake Tenghiz, the
Small Horde is fixed in the west, between the rivers
Yemba and Ural; the Great Horde in the east; while
the most powerful occupies the centre between the
Sarasu and Yemba, and is called the Middle Horde.
Since 1819, the Great Horde has been subject to Russia.
Other Kirgis tribes, though nominally subject to
Russia, are really her most dangerous enemies.
</p>

<pb n='306'/><anchor id='Pg306'/>

<p>
The Turks of Asia Minor and Syria came from
Khorasan and Eastern Persia, and are Turkmans, or
remnants of the Seljuks, the rulers of Persia during
the Middle Ages. The Osmanli, whom we are accustomed
to call Turks <emph>par excellence</emph>, and who form
the ruling portion of the Turkish empire, must be traced
to the same source. They are now scattered over the
whole Turkish empire in Europe, Asia, and Africa,
and their number amounts to between 11,000,000
and 12,000,000. They form the landed gentry, the
aristocracy, and bureaucracy of Turkey; and their
language, the Osmanli, is spoken by persons of rank
and education, and by all government authorities in
Syria, in Egypt, at Tunis, and at Tripoli. In the
southern provinces of Asiatic Russia, along the borders
of the Caspian, and through the whole of Turkestan,
it is the language of the people. It is heard even at
the court of Teheran, and is understood by official personages
in Persia.
</p>

<p>
The rise of this powerful tribe of Osman, and the
spreading of that Turkish dialect which is now emphatically
called the Turkish, are matters of historical
notoriety. We need not search for evidence in Chinese
annals, or try to discover analogies between names that
a Greek or an Arabic writer may by chance have heard
and handed down to us, and which some of these tribes
have preserved to the present day. The ancestors of
the Osman Turks are men as well known to European
historians as Charlemagne or Alfred. It was in the
year 1224 that Soliman-shah and his tribe, pressed by
Mongolians, left Khorasan and pushed westward into
Syria, Armenia, and Asia Minor. Soliman's son, Ertoghrul,
took service under Aladdin, the Seljuk Sultan
<pb n='307'/><anchor id='Pg307'/>
of Iconium (Nicæa), and after several successful campaigns
against Greeks and Mongolians, received part
of Phrygia as his own, and there founded what was
afterwards to become the basis of the Osmanic empire.
During the last years of the thirteenth century the
Sultans of Iconium lost their power, and their former
vassals became independent sovereigns. Osman, after
taking his share of the spoil in Asia, advanced through
the Olympic passes into Bithynia and was successful
against the armies of the Emperors of Byzantium.
Osman became henceforth the national name of his
people. His son, Orkhan, whose capital was Prusa
(Bursa), after conquering Nicomedia (1327) and Nicæa
(1330), threatened the Hellespont. He took the
title of Padishah, and his court was called the <q>High
Porte.</q> His son, Soliman, crossed the Hellespont
(1357), and took possession of Gallipoli and Sestos.
He thus became master of the Dardanelles. Murad I.
took Adrianople (1362), made it his capital, conquered
Macedonia, and, after a severe struggle, overthrew the
united forces of the Slavonic races south of the Danube,
the Bulgarians, Servians, and Kroatians, in the battle
of Kossova-polye (1389). He fell himself, but his successor
Bayazeth, followed his course, took Thessaly,
passed Thermopylæ, and devastated the Peloponnesus.
The Emperor of Germany, Sigismund, who advanced
at the head of an army composed of French, German,
and Slavonic soldiers, was defeated by Bayazeth on the
Danube in the battle of Nicopolis, 1399. Bayazeth
took Bosnia, and would have taken Constantinople, had
not the same Mongolians, who in 1244 drove the first
Turkish tribes westward into Persia, threatened again
their newly acquired possessions. Timur had grasped
the reins fallen from the hands of Chingis-khán: Bayazeth
<pb n='308'/><anchor id='Pg308'/>
was compelled to meet him, and suffered defeat
(1402) in the battle of Angora (Ankyra) in Galatia.
</p>

<p>
Europe now had respite, but not long; Timur died,
and with him his empire fell to pieces, while the Osmanic
army rallied again under Mahomet I. (1413),
and re-attained its former power under Murad II.
(1421). Successful in Asia, Murad sent his armies
back to the Danube, and after long-continued campaigns,
and powerful resistance from the Hungarians
and Slaves under Hunyad, he at last gained two decisive
victories; Varna in 1444, and Kossova in 1448.
Constantinople could no longer be held, and the Pope
endeavored in vain to rouse the chivalry of Western
Europe to a crusade against the Turks. Mahomet II.
succeeded in 1451, and on the 26th of May, 1453, Constantinople,
after a valiant resistance, fell, and became
the capital of the Turkish empire.
</p>

<p>
It is a real pleasure to read a Turkish grammar,
even though one may have no wish to acquire it practically.
The ingenious manner in which the numerous
grammatical forms are brought out, the regularity which
pervades the system of declension and conjugation, the
transparency and intelligibility of the whole structure,
must strike all who have a sense of that wonderful
power of the human mind which has displayed itself in
language. Given so small a number of graphic and demonstrative
roots as would hardly suffice to express
the commonest wants of human beings, to produce
an instrument that shall render the faintest shades
of feeling and thought;&mdash;given a vague infinitive or
a stern imperative, to derive from it such moods as
an optative or subjunctive, and tenses as an aorist
or paulo-post future;&mdash;given incoherent utterances, to
arrange them into a system where all is uniform and
<pb n='309'/><anchor id='Pg309'/>
regular, all combined and harmonious;&mdash;such is the
work of the human mind which we see realized in
<q>language.</q> But in most languages nothing of this
early process remains visible. They stand before us
like solid rocks, and the microscope of the philologist
alone can reveal the remains of organic life with which
they are built up.
</p>

<p>
In the grammar of the Turkic languages, on the contrary,
we have before us a language of perfectly transparent
structure, and a grammar the inner workings of
which we can study, as if watching the building of cells
in a crystal bee-hive. An eminent orientalist remarked
<q>we might imagine Turkish to be the result of the deliberations
of some eminent society of learned men;</q>
but no such society could have devised what the mind
of man produced, left to itself in the steppes of Tatary,
and guided only by its innate laws, or by an instinctive
power as wonderful as any within the realm
of nature.
</p>

<p>
Let us examine a few forms. <q>To love,</q> in the
most general sense of the word, or love, as a root, is in
Turkish <emph>sev</emph>. This does not yet mean <q>to love,</q>
which is <emph>sevmek</emph>, or <q>love</q> as a substantive, which is
<emph>sevgu</emph> or <emph>sevi</emph>; but it only expresses the general idea of
loving in the abstract. This root, as we remarked before,
can never be touched. Whatever syllables may
be added for the modification of its meaning, the root
itself must stand out in full prominence like a pearl set
in diamonds. It must never be changed or broken,
assimilated or modified, as in the English I fall, I fell,
I take, I took, I think, I thought, and similar forms.
With this one restriction, however, we are free to treat
it at pleasure.
</p>

<pb n='310'/><anchor id='Pg310'/>

<p>
Let us suppose we possessed nothing like our conjugation,
but had to express such ideas as I love, thou
lovest, and the rest, for the first time. Nothing would
seem more natural now than to form an adjective or a
participle, meaning <q>loving,</q> and then add the different
pronouns, as I loving, thou loving, &amp;c. Exactly
this the Turks have done. We need not inquire at
present how they produced what we call a participle.
It was a task, however, by no means so facile as we
now conceive it. In Turkish, one participle is formed
by <emph>er</emph>. <emph>Sev</emph>+<emph>er</emph> would, therefore, mean lov+er or
lov+ing. Thou, in Turkish, is <emph>sen</emph>, and as all modificatory
syllables are placed at the end of the root, we
get <emph>sev-er-sen</emph>, thou lovest. You in Turkish is <emph>siz</emph>;
hence <emph>sev-er-siz</emph>, you love. In these cases the pronouns
and the terminations of the verb coincide exactly. In
other persons the coincidences are less complete, because
the pronominal terminations have sometimes been
modified, or, as in the third person singular, <emph>sever</emph>,
dropped altogether as unnecessary. A reference to
other cognate languages, however, where either the
terminations or the pronouns themselves have maintained
a more primitive form, enables us to say that in
the original Turkish verb, all persons of the present
were formed by means of pronouns appended to this
participle <emph>sever</emph>. Instead of <q>I love, thou lovest, he
loves,</q> the Turkish grammarian says, <q>lover-I, lover-thou,
lover.</q>
</p>

<p>
But these personal terminations are not the same in
the imperfect as in the present.
</p>

<table rend="latexcolumns: 'p{3cm} p{3cm}'; tblcolumns: 'lw(25) lw(25)'">

</table>

<p>
We need not inquire as yet into the origin of the <emph>di</emph>,
added to form the imperfect; but it should be stated
that in the first person plural of the imperfect a various
reading occurs in other Tataric dialects, and that <emph>miz</emph>
is used there instead of <emph>k</emph>. Now, looking at these terminations
<emph>m</emph>, <emph>ñ</emph>, <emph>i</emph>, <emph>miz</emph>,
<emph>ñiz</emph>, and <emph>ler</emph>, we find that they
are exactly the same as the possessive pronouns used
after nouns. As the Italian says <emph>fratelmo</emph>, my brother,
and as in Hebrew we say, <emph>El-i</emph>, God (of) I, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> my
God, the Tataric languages form the phrases <q>my
house, thy house, his house,</q> by possessive pronouns
appended to substantives. A Turk says,&mdash;
</p>

<table rend="latexcolumns: 'p{2cm} p{2cm} p{2cm} p{2cm}';

</table>

<p>
We may hence infer that in the imperfect these pronominal
terminations were originally taken in a possessive
sense, and that, therefore, what remains after
the personal terminations are removed, <emph>sever-di</emph>, was
never an adjective or a participle, but must have been
originally a substantive capable of receiving terminal
possessive pronouns; that is, the idea originally expressed
by the imperfect could not have been <q>loving-I,</q>
but <q>love of me.</q>
</p>

<p>
How then, could this convey the idea of a past tense
as contrasted with the present? Let us look to our
<pb n='312'/><anchor id='Pg312'/>
own language. If desirous to express the perfect, we
say, I have loved, <emph>j'ai aimé</emph>. This <q>I have,</q> meant
originally, I possess, and in Latin <q>amicus quem amatum
habeo,</q> signified in fact a friend whom I hold dear,&mdash;not
as yet, whom I <emph>have</emph> loved. In the course of
time, however, these phrases, <q>I have said, I have
loved,</q> took the sense of the perfect, and of time past&mdash;and
not unnaturally, inasmuch as what I <emph>hold</emph>, or
<emph>have</emph> done, <emph>is</emph> done;&mdash;done, as we say, and past. In
place of an auxiliary possessive verb, the Turkish language
uses an auxiliary possessive pronoun to the same
effect. <q>Paying belonging to me,</q> equals <q>I have
paid;</q> in either case a phrase originally possessive,
took a temporal signification, and became a past or
perfect tense. This, however, is the very anatomy of
grammar, and when a Turk says <q>severdim</q> he is,
of course, as unconscious of its literal force, <q>loving
belonging to me,</q> as of the circulation of his blood.
</p>

<p>
The most ingenious part of Turkish is undoubtedly
the verb. Like Greek and Sanskrit, it exhibits a variety
of moods and tenses, sufficient to express the nicest
shades of doubt, of surmise, of hope, and supposition.
In all these forms the root remains intact, and sounds
like a key-note through all the various modulations
produced by the changes of person, number, mood, and
time. But there is one feature so peculiar to the Turkish
verb, that no analogy can be found in any of the
Aryan languages&mdash;the power of producing new verbal
bases by the mere addition of certain letters, which give
to every verb a negative, or causative, or reflexive, or
reciprocal meaning.
</p>

<p>
<emph>Sev-mek</emph>, for instance, as a simple root, means to love.
By adding <emph>in</emph>, we obtain a reflexive verb, <emph>sev-in-mek</emph>,
<pb n='313'/><anchor id='Pg313'/>
which means to love oneself, or rather, to rejoice, to
be happy. This may now be conjugated through all
moods and tenses, <emph>sevin</emph> being in every respect equal
to a new root. By adding <emph>ish</emph> we form a reciprocal
verb, <emph>sev-ish-mek</emph>, to love one another.
</p>

<p>
To each of these three forms a causative sense
may be imparted by the addition of the syllable <emph>dir</emph>.
Thus,
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>i.</hi> <emph>sev-mek</emph>, to love, becomes
<hi rend='smallcaps'>iv.</hi> <emph>sev-dir-mek</emph>, to cause to love.

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>ii.</hi> <emph>sev-in-mek</emph>, to rejoice, becomes

<hi rend='smallcaps'>vi.</hi> <emph>sev-ish-dir-mek</emph>,
to cause one to love one another.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
Each of these six forms may again be turned into a
passive by the addition of <emph>il</emph>. Thus,
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>i.</hi> <emph>sev-mek</emph>, to love, becomes
<hi rend='smallcaps'>vii.</hi> <emph>sev-il-mek</emph>, to be loved.

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>iii.</hi> <emph>sev-ish-mek</emph>, to love one another, becomes
<hi rend='smallcaps'>ix.</hi> <emph>sev-ish-il-mek</emph>,

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>iv.</hi> <emph>sev-dir-mek</emph>, to cause one to love, becomes

to be brought to love.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='smallcaps'>v.</hi> <emph>sev-in-dir-mek</emph>, to cause to rejoice, becomes
<hi rend='smallcaps'>xi.</hi> <emph>sev-in-dir-il-mek</emph>,

</p>

<p>

one another, becomes
<hi rend='smallcaps'>xii.</hi> <emph>sev-ish-dir-il-mek</emph>, to
be brought to love one another.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
This, however, is by no means the whole verbal
contingent at the command of a Turkish grammarian.
Every one of these twelve secondary or tertiary roots
may again be turned into a negative by the mere addition
of <emph>me</emph>. Thus, <emph>sev-mek</emph>, to love, becomes <emph>sev-me-mek</emph>,
not to love. And if it is necessary to express the
impossibility of loving, the Turk has a new root at
<pb n='314'/><anchor id='Pg314'/>
hand to convey even that idea. Thus while <emph>sev-me-mek</emph>
denies only the fact of loving, <emph>sev-eme-mek</emph>, denies
its possibility, and means not to be able to love. By
the addition of these two modificatory syllables, the
numbers of derivative roots is at once raised to thirty-six.
Thus,
</p>

<quote rend='display'>

Some of these forms are of course of rare occurrence,
and with many verbs these derivative roots, though
possible grammatically, would be logically impossible.
Even a verb like <q>to love,</q> perhaps the most pliant
of all, resists some of the modifications to which a
<pb n='315'/><anchor id='Pg315'/>
Turkish grammarian is fain to subject it. It is clear,
however, that wherever a negation can be formed, the
idea of impossibility also can be superadded, so that by
substituting <emph>eme</emph> for <emph>me</emph>, we should raise the number of
derivative roots to thirty-six. The very last of these,
<hi rend='smallcaps'>xxxvi.</hi> <emph>sev-ish-dir-il-eme-mek</emph> would
be perfectly intelligible,
and might be used, for instance, if, in speaking
of the Sultan and the Czar, we wished to say, that it
was impossible that they should be brought to love one
another.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Finnic Class.</hi>
</p>

<p>
It is generally supposed that the original seat of the
Finnic tribes was in the Ural mountains, and their
languages have been therefore called <emph>Uralic</emph>. From
this centre they spread east and west; and southward
in ancient times, even to the Black Sea, where Finnic
tribes, together with Mongolic and Turkic, were probably
known to the Greeks under the comprehensive
and convenient name of Scythians. As we possess no
literary documents of any of these nomadic nations, it
is impossible to say, even where Greek writers have
preserved their barbarous names, to what branch of
the vast Turanian family they belonged. Their habits
were probably identical before the Christian era, during
the Middle Ages, and at the present day. One tribe
takes possession of a tract and retains it perhaps for
several generations, and gives its name to the meadows
where it tends its flocks, and to the rivers where the
horses are watered. If the country be fertile, it will
attract the eye of other tribes; wars begin, and if resistance
be hopeless, hundreds of families fly from their
paternal pastures, to migrate perhaps for generations,&mdash;for
<pb n='316'/><anchor id='Pg316'/>
migration they find a more natural life than permanent
habitation,&mdash;and after a time we may rediscover
their names a thousand miles distant. Or two
tribes will carry on their warfare for ages, till with
reduced numbers both have perhaps to make common
cause against some new enemy.
</p>

<p>
During these continued struggles their languages
lose as many words as men are killed on the field of
battle. Some words (we might say) go over, others
are made prisoners, and exchanged again during times
of peace. Besides, there are parleys and challenges,
and at last a dialect is produced which may very properly
be called a language of the camp, (Urdu-zebán,
camp-language, is the proper name of Hindustání,
formed in the armies of the Mogul emperors,) but
where it is difficult for the philologist to arrange the
living and to number the slain, unless some salient
points of grammar have been preserved throughout the
medley. We saw how a number of tribes may be at
times suddenly gathered by the command of a Chingis-khán
or Timur, like billows heaving and swelling at
the call of a thunder-storm. One such wave rolling
on from Karakorum to Liegnitz may sweep away all the
sheepfolds and landmarks of centuries, and when the
storm is over, a thin crust will, as after a flood, remain,
concealing the underlying stratum of people and languages.
</p>

<p>
On the evidence of language, the Finnic stock is
divided into four branches,
</p>

<lg>
<l>The Chudic,</l>
<l>The Bulgaric,</l>
<l>The Permic,</l>
<l>The Ugric.</l>
</lg>

<pb n='317'/><anchor id='Pg317'/>

<p>
The Chudic branch comprises the Finnic of the Baltic
coasts. The name is derived from Chud (Tchud)
originally applied by the Russians to the Finnic nations
in the north-west of Russia. Afterwards it took
a more general sense, and was used almost synonymously
with Scythian for all the tribes of Central and
Northern Asia. The Finns, properly so called, or as
they call themselves Suomalainen, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> inhabitants of
fens, are settled in the provinces of Finland (formerly
belonging to Sweden, but since 1809 annexed to Russia),
and in parts of the governments of Archangel and
Olonetz. Their number is stated at 1,521,515. The
Finns are the most advanced of their whole family,
and are, the Magyars excepted, the only Finnic race
that can claim a station among the civilized and civilizing
nations of the world. Their literature and, above
all, their popular poetry bear witness to a high intellectual
development in times which we may call mythical,
and in places more favorable to the glow of poetical
feelings than their present abode, the last refuge
Europe could afford them. The epic songs still live
among the poorest, recorded by oral tradition alone,
and preserving all the features of a perfect metre and
of a more ancient language. A national feeling has
lately arisen amongst the Finns, despite of Russian supremacy,
and the labors of Sjögern, Lönnrot, Castrén,
and Kellgren, receiving hence a powerful impulse, have
produced results truly surprising. From the mouths
of the aged an epic poem has been collected equalling
the Iliad in length and completeness, nay, if we can
forget for a moment all that <emph>we</emph> in our youth learned
to call beautiful, not less beautiful. A Finn is not a
Greek, and Wainamoinen was not a Homer. But if
<pb n='318'/><anchor id='Pg318'/>
the poet may take his colors from that nature by which
he is surrounded, if he may depict the men with whom
he lives, <q>Kalewala</q> possesses merits not dissimilar from
those of the Iliad, and will claim its place as the fifth
national epic of the world, side by side with the Ionian
songs, with the Mahábhárata, the Shahnámeh, and the
Nibelunge. This early literary cultivation has not
been without a powerful influence on the language.
It has imparted permanency to its forms and a traditional
character to its words, so that at first sight we
might almost doubt whether the grammar of this language
had not left the agglutinative stage, and entered
into the current of inflection with Greek or Sanskrit.
The agglutinative type, however, yet remains, and its
grammar shows a luxuriance of grammatical combination
second only to Turkish and Hungarian. Like
Turkish it observes the <q>harmony of vowels,</q> a feature
peculiar to Turanian languages, as explained
before.
</p>

<p>
Karelian and Tavastian are dialectical varieties of
Finnish.
</p>

<p>
The Esths or Esthonians, neighbors to the Finns,
speak a language closely allied to the Finnish. It is
divided into the dialects of Dorpat (in Livonia) and
Reval. Except some popular songs it is almost without
literature. Esthonia, together with Livonia and
Kurland, forms the three Baltic provinces of Russia.
The population on the islands of the Gulf of Finland
is mostly Esthonian. In the higher ranks of society
Esthonian is hardly understood, and never spoken.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Finns and Esthonians, the Livonians
and the Lapps must be reckoned also amongst the
same family. Their number, however, is small. The
<pb n='319'/><anchor id='Pg319'/>
population of Livonia consists chiefly of Esths, Letts,
Russians, and Germans. The number of Livonians
speaking their own dialect is not more than 5000.
</p>

<p>
The Lapps, or Laplanders, inhabit the most northern
part of Europe. They belong to Sweden and
Russia. Their number is estimated at 28,000. Their
language has lately attracted much attention, and Castrén's
travels give a description of their manners most
interesting from its simplicity and faithfulness.
</p>

<p>
The Bulgaria branch comprises the Tcheremissians
and Mordvinians, scattered in disconnected colonies
along the Volga, and surrounded by Russian and Tataric
dialects. Both languages are extremely artificial
in their grammar, and allow an accumulation of pronominal
affixes at the end of verbs, surpassed only by
the Bask, the Caucasian, and those American dialects
that have been called Polysynthetic.
</p>

<p>
The general name given to these tribes, Bulgaric,
is not borrowed from Bulgaria, on the Danube; Bulgaria,
on the contrary, received its name (replacing
Moesia) from the Finnic armies by whom it was conquered
in the seventh century. Bulgarian tribes advanced
from the Volga to the Don, and after remaining
for a time under the sovereignty of the Avars on
the Don and Dnieper, they advanced to the Danube in
635, and founded the Bulgarian kingdom. This has
retained its name to the present day, though the Finnic
Bulgarians have long been absorbed by Slavonic inhabitants,
and both brought under Turkish sway since
1392.
</p>

<p>
The third, or Permic branch, comprises the idioms
of the Votiakes, the Sirianes, and the Permians,
three dialects of one language. <emph>Perm</emph> was the ancient
<pb n='320'/><anchor id='Pg320'/>
name for the country between 61°-76° <hi rend='smallcaps'>e.</hi> lon. and
55°-65° <hi rend='smallcaps'>n.</hi> lat. The Permic tribes were driven westward
by their eastern neighbors, the Voguls, and thus
pressed upon their western neighbors, the Bulgars
of the Volga. The Votiakes are found between the
rivers Vyatka and Kama. Northwards follow the
Sirianes, inhabiting the country on the Upper Kâma,
while the eastern portion is held by the Permians.
These are surrounded on the south by the Tatars of
Orenburg and the Bashkirs; on the north by the
Samoyedes, and on the east by Voguls, who pressed
on them from the Ural.
</p>

<p>
These Voguls, together with Hungarians and Ostiakes,
form the fourth and last branch of the Finnic
family, the Ugric. It was in 462, after the dismemberment
of Attila's Hunnic empire that these Ugric
tribes approached Europe. They were then called
Onagurs, Saragurs, and Urogs; and in later times
they occur in Russian chronicles as Ugry. They are
the ancestors of the Hungarians, and should not be
confounded with the Uigurs, an ancient Turkic tribe
mentioned before.
</p>

<p>
The similarity between the Hungarian language and
dialects of Finnic origin, spoken east of the Volga, is
not a new discovery. In 1253, Wilhelm Ruysbroeck,
a priest who travelled beyond the Volga, remarked
that a race called Pascatir, who live on the Yaïk,
spoke the same language as the Hungarians. They
were then settled east of the old Bulgarian kingdom,
the capital of which, the ancient Bolgari, on the left
of the Volga, may still be traced in the ruins of Spask.
If these Pascatir&mdash;the portion of the Ugric tribes that
remained east of the Volga&mdash;are identical with the
<pb n='321'/><anchor id='Pg321'/>
Bashkir, as Klaproth supposes, it would follow that,
in later times, they gave up their language, for the
present Bashkir no longer speak a Hungarian, but a
Turkic, dialect. The affinity of the Hungarian and
the Ugro-Finnic dialects was first proved philologically
by Gyarmathi in 1799.
</p>

<p>
A few instances may suffice to show this connection:&mdash;

<p>
We have thus examined the four chief classes of the
Turanian family, the Tungusic, Mongolic, Turkic, and
Finnic. The Tungusic branch stands lowest; its grammar
is not much richer than Chinese, and in its structure
there is an absence of that architectonic order
which in Chinese makes the Cyclopean stones of language
hold together without cement. This applies,
however, principally to the Mandshu; other Tungusic
dialects spoken, not in China, but in the original seats
of the Mandshus, are even now beginning to develop
grammatical forms.
</p>

<p>
The Mongolic dialects excel the Tungusic, but in
their grammar can hardly distinguish between the
different parts of speech. The spoken idioms of the
Mongolians, as of the Tungusians, are evidently struggling
towards a more organic life, and Castrén has
brought home evidence of incipient verbal growth in
the language of the Buriäts and a Tungusic dialect
spoken near Nyertchinsk.
</p>

<p>
This is, however, only a small beginning, if compared
with the profusion of grammatical resources displayed
by the Turkic languages. In their system of
conjugation, the Turkic dialects can hardly be surpassed.
Their verbs are like branches which break
down under the heavy burden of fruits and blossoms.
The excellence of the Finnic languages consists rather
in a diminution than increase of verbal forms; but in
declension Finnish is even richer than Turkish.
</p>

<p>
These four classes, together with the Samoyedic,
constitute the northern or Ural-Altaic division of the
Turanian family.
</p>

<p>
The southern division consists of the Tamulic, the
Gangetic (Trans-Himalayan and Sub-Himalayan), the
<pb n='324'/><anchor id='Pg324'/>
Lohitic, the Taïc, and the Malaïc classes.<note place='foot'>Of
these I can only give a tabular survey at the end of these Lectures,
referring for further particulars to my <q>Letter on the Turanian Languages.</q>
The Gangetic and Lohitic dialects are those comprehended under the name
of Bhotîya.</note> These two
divisions comprehend very nearly all the languages of
Asia, with the exception of Chinese, which, together
with its neighboring dialects, forms the only representative
of radical or monosyllabic speech. A few, such
as Japanese,<note place='foot'>Professor Boller of Vienna, who
has given a most accurate analysis of
the Turanian languages in the <q>Transactions of the Vienna Academy,</q>
has lately established the Turanian character of Japanese.</note>
the language of Korea, of the Koriakes,
the Kamchadales, and the numerous dialects of the
Caucasus, &amp;c., remain unclassed; but in them also
some traces of a common origin with the Turanian
languages have, it is probable, survived, and await the
discovery of philological research.
</p>

<p>
Of the third, or inflectional, stage, I need not say
much, as we have examined its structure when analyzing
in our former Lectures a number of words in Sanskrit,
Greek, Latin, or any other of the Aryan languages.
The chief distinction between an inflectional
and an agglutinative language consists in the fact that
agglutinative languages preserve the consciousness of
their roots, and therefore do not allow them to be affected
by phonetic corruption; and, though they have
lost the consciousness of the original meaning of their
terminations, they feel distinctly the difference between
the significative root, and the modifying elements.
Not so in the inflectional languages. There
the various elements which enter into the composition
of words, may become so welded together, and suffer
so much from phonetic corruption, that none but the
<pb n='325'/><anchor id='Pg325'/>
educated would be aware of an original distinction
between root and termination, and none but the comparative
grammarian able to discover the seams that
separate the component parts.
</p>

<p>
If you consider the character of our morphological
classification, you will see that this classification, differing
thereby from the genealogical, must be applicable
to all languages. Our classification exhausts all possibilities.
If the component elements of language are
roots, predicative and demonstrative, we cannot have
more than three combinations. Roots may either remain
roots without any modification; or secondly, they
may be joined so that one determines the other and
loses its independent existence; or thirdly, they may
be joined and be allowed to coalesce, so that both lose
their independent existence. The number of roots
which enter into the composition of a word makes no
difference, and it is unnecessary, therefore, to admit a
fourth class, sometimes called <emph>polysynthetic</emph>, or <emph>incorporating</emph>,
including most of the American languages. As
long as in these sesquipedalian compounds, the significative
root remains distinct, they belong to the agglutinative
stage; as soon as it is absorbed by the terminations,
they belong to the inflectional stage. Nor is it necessary
to distinguish between <emph>synthetic</emph> and <emph>analytical</emph>
languages, including under the former name the ancient,
and under the latter the modern, languages of
the inflectional class. The formation of such phrases
as the French <emph>j'aimerai</emph>, for <emph>j'ai à aimer</emph>, or the English,
<emph>I shall do</emph>, <emph>thou wilt do</emph>, may be called
<emph>analytical</emph> or
<emph>metaphrastic</emph>. But in their morphological nature these
phrases are still inflectional. If we analyze such a
phrase as <emph>je vivrai</emph>, we find it was originally <emph>ego</emph> (Sanskrit
<pb n='326'/><anchor id='Pg326'/>
<emph>aham</emph>) <emph>vivere</emph> (Sanskrit <emph>jîv-as-e</emph>,
dat. neut.) <emph>habeo</emph>
(Sanskrit <emph>bhâ-vayâ-mi</emph>); that is to say, we have a
number of words in which grammatical articulation
has been almost entirely destroyed, but has not been
cast off; whereas in Turanian languages grammatical
forms are produced by the combination of integral
roots, and the old and useless terminations are first discarded
before any new combination takes place.<note place='foot'>Letter
on the Turanian Languages, p. 75.</note>
</p>

<p>
At the end of our morphological classification a
problem presents itself, which we might have declined
to enter upon if we had confined ourselves to a genealogical
classification. At the end of our genealogical
classification we had to confess that only a certain number
of languages had as yet been arranged genealogically,
and that therefore the time for approaching the
problem of the common origin of all languages had not
yet come. Now, however, although we have not specified
all languages which belong to the radical, the terminational,
and inflectional classes, we have clearly
laid it down as a principle, that all languages must fall
under one or the other of these three categories of
human speech. It would not be consistent, therefore,
to shrink from the consideration of a problem, which,
though beset with many difficulties, cannot be excluded
from the science of language.
</p>

<p>
Let us first see our problem clearly and distinctly.
The problem of the common origin of languages has
no necessary connection with the problem of the common
origin of mankind. If it could be proved that
languages had had different beginnings, this would in
nowise necessitate the admission of different beginnings
of the human race. For if we look upon language as
<pb n='327'/><anchor id='Pg327'/>
natural to man, it might have broken out at different
times and in different countries among the scattered
descendants of one original pair; if, on the contrary,
language is to be treated as an artificial invention, there
is still less reason why each succeeding generation should
not have invented its own idiom.
</p>

<p>
Nor would it follow, if it could be proved that all
the dialects of mankind point to one common source,
that therefore the human race must descend from one
pair. For language might have been the property of
one favored race, and have been communicated to the
other races in the progress of history.
</p>

<p>
The science of language and the science of ethnology
have both suffered most seriously from being
mixed up together. The classification of races and
languages should be quite independent of each other.
Races may change their languages, and history supplies
us with several instances where one race adopted
the language of another. Different languages, therefore,
may be spoken by one race, or the same language
may be spoken by different races; so that any attempt
at squaring the classification of races and tongues must
necessarily fail.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, the problem of the common origin of languages
has no connection with the statements contained
in the Old Testament regarding the creation of man,
and the genealogies of the patriarchs. If our researches
led us to the admission of different beginnings
for the languages of mankind, there is nothing in the
Old Testament opposed to this view. For although
the Jews believed that for a time the whole earth was
of one language and of one speech, it has long been
pointed out by eminent divines, with particular reference
<pb n='328'/><anchor id='Pg328'/>
to the dialects of America, that new languages
might have arisen at later times. If, on the contrary,
we arrive at the conviction that all languages can be
traced back to one common source, we could never
think of transferring the genealogies of the Old Testament
to the genealogical classification of language.
The genealogies of the Old Testament refer to blood,
not to language, and as we know that people, without
changing their name, did frequently change their language,
it is clearly impossible that the genealogies of
the Old Testament should coincide with the genealogical
classification of languages. In order to avoid a
confusion of ideas, it would be preferable to abstain
altogether from using the same names to express relationship
of language which in the Bible are used to
express relationship of blood. It was usual formerly
to speak of <emph>Japhetic</emph>, <emph>Hamitic</emph> and <emph>Semitic</emph>
languages. The first name has now been replaced by <emph>Aryan</emph>, the
second by <emph>African</emph>; and though the third is still retained,
it has received a scientific definition quite different
from the meaning which it would have in the Bible.
It is well to bear this in mind, in order to prevent not
only those who are forever attacking the Bible with
arrows that cannot reach it, but likewise those who
defend it with weapons they know not how to wield,
from disturbing in any way the quiet progress of the
science of language.
</p>

<p>
Let us now look dispassionately at our problem.
The problem of the possibility of a common origin of
all languages naturally divides itself into two parts, the
<emph>formal</emph> and the <emph>material</emph>. We are to-day concerned
with the formal part only. We have examined all
possible forms which language can assume, and we
<pb n='329'/><anchor id='Pg329'/>
have now to ask, can we reconcile with these three
distinct forms, the radical, the terminational, and the
inflectional, the admission of one common origin of
human speech? I answer decidedly, Yes.
</p>

<p>
The chief argument that has been brought forward
against the common origin of language is this, that no
monosyllabic or radical language has ever entered into
an agglutinative or terminational stage, and that no
agglutinative or terminational language has ever risen
to the inflectional stage. Chinese, it is said, is still
what it has been from the beginning; it has never
produced agglutinative or inflectional forms; nor has
any Turanian language ever given up the distinctive
feature of the terminational stage, namely, the integrity
of its roots.
</p>

<p>
In answer to this it should be pointed out that though
each language, as soon as it once becomes settled, retains
that morphological character which it had when it first
assumed its individual or national existence, it does not
lose altogether the power of producing grammatical
forms that belong to a higher stage. In Chinese, and
particularly in Chinese dialects, we find rudimentary
traces of agglutination. The <emph>li</emph> which I mentioned
before as the sign of the locative, has dwindled down
to a mere postposition, and a modern Chinese is no
more aware that <emph>li</emph> meant originally interior, than the
Turanian is of the origin of his case-terminations.<note place='foot'><p>M.
Stanislas Julien remarks that the numerous compounds which occur
in Chinese prove the wide-spread influence of the principle of agglutination
in that language. The fact is, that in Chinese every sound has numerous
meanings; and in order to avoid ambiguity, one word is frequently followed
by another which agrees with it in that particular meaning which is
intended by the speaker. Thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<emph>chi-youen</emph> (beginning-origin) signifies beginning.<lb/>
<emph>ken-youen</emph> (root-origin) signifies beginning.<lb/>
<emph>youen-chi</emph>n (origin-beginning) signifies beginning.<lb/>
<emph>meï-miai</emph> (beautiful-remarkable) signifies beautiful.<lb/>
<emph>meï-li</emph> (beautiful-elegant) signifies beautiful.<lb/>
<emph>chen-youen</emph> (charming-lovely) signifies beautiful.<lb/>
<emph>yong-i</emph> (easy-facile) signifies easily.<lb/>
<emph>tsong-yong</emph> (to obey, easy) signifies easily.
</p>
<p>
In order to express <q>to boast,</q> the Chinese say <emph>king-koua</emph>,
<emph>king-fu</emph>, &amp;c.,
both words having one and the same meaning.
</p>
<p>
This peculiar system of <emph>juxta-position</emph>, however, cannot be considered as
agglutination in the strict sense of the word.</p></note> In
<pb n='330'/><anchor id='Pg330'/>
the spoken dialects of Chinese, agglutinative forms are
of more frequent occurrence. Thus, in the Shanghai
dialect, <emph>wo</emph> is to speak, as a verb; <emph>woda</emph>, a word. Of
<emph>woda</emph> a genitive is formed, <emph>woda-ka</emph>,
a dative <emph>pela woda</emph>, an accusative <emph>tang
woda</emph>.<note place='foot'>Turanian Languages, p. 24.</note>
In agglutinative languages
again, we meet with rudimentary traces of inflection.
Thus in Tamil the root <emph>tûngu</emph>, to sleep, has not retained
its full integrity in the derivative <emph>tûkkam</emph>, sleep.
</p>

<p>
I mention these instances, which might be greatly
multiplied, in order to show that there is nothing
mysterious in the tenacity with which each language
clings in general to that stage of grammar which it
had attained at the time of its first settlement. If a
family, or a tribe, or a nation, has once accustomed
itself to express its ideas according to one system of
grammar, that first mould remains and becomes
stronger with each generation. But, while Chinese
was arrested and became traditional in this very early
stage the radical, other dialects passed on through that
stage, retaining their pliancy. They were not arrested,
and did not become traditional or national, before those
who spoke them had learnt to appreciate the advantage
of agglutination. That advantage being once perceived,
a few single forms in which agglutination first showed
itself would soon, by that sense of analogy which is inherent
<pb n='331'/><anchor id='Pg331'/>
in language, extend their influence irresistibly.
Languages arrested in that stage would cling with
equal tenacity to the system of agglutination. A Chinese
can hardly understand how language is possible,
unless every syllable is significative; a Turanian despises
every idiom in which each word does not display
distinctly its radical and significative element; whereas,
we who are accustomed to the use of inflectional languages,
are proud of the very grammar which a Chinese
and Turanian would treat with contempt.
</p>

<p>
The fact, therefore, that languages, if once settled,
do not change their grammatical constitution, is no
argument against our theory, that every inflectional
language was once agglutinative, and every agglutinative
language was once monosyllabic. I call it a
theory, but it is more than a theory, for it is the only
possible way in which the realities of Sanskrit or any
other inflectional language can be explained. As far
as the formal part of language is concerned, we cannot
resist the conclusion that what is now <emph>inflectional</emph> was
formerly <emph>agglutinative</emph>, and what is now <emph>agglutinative</emph>
was at first <emph>radical</emph>. The great stream of language
rolled on in numberless dialects, and changed its
grammatical coloring as it passed from time to time
through new deposits of thought. The different
channels which left the main current and became
stationary and stagnant, or, if you like, literary and
traditional, retained forever that coloring which the
main current displayed at the stage of their separation.
If we call the radical stage <emph>white</emph>, the agglutinative
<emph>red</emph>, and the inflectional <emph>blue</emph>, then we may well
understand why the white channels should show hardly
a drop of red or blue, or why the red channels should
<pb n='332'/><anchor id='Pg332'/>
hardly betray a shadow of blue; and we shall be prepared
to find what we do find, namely, white tints in
the red, and white and red tints in the blue channels
of speech.
</p>

<p>
You will have perceived that in what I have said I
only argue for the possibility, not for the necessity, of a
common origin of language.
</p>

<p>
I look upon the problem of the common origin of
language, which I have shown to be quite independent
of the problem of the common origin of mankind, as
a question which ought to be kept open as long as possible.
It is not, I believe, a problem quite as hopeless
as that of the plurality of worlds, on which so much
has been written of late, but it should be treated very
much in the same manner. As it is impossible to demonstrate
by the evidence of the senses that the planets
are inhabited, the only way to prove that they
are, is to prove that it is impossible that they should
not be. Thus on the other hand, in order to prove
that the planets are not inhabited, you must prove
that it is impossible that they should be. As soon
as the one or the other has been proved, the question
will be set at rest: till then it must remain an
open question, whatever our own predilections on the
subject may be.
</p>

<p>
I do not take quite as desponding a view of the
problem of the common origin of language, but I
insist on this, that we ought not to allow this problem
to be in any way prejudged. Now it has been the
tendency of the most distinguished writers on comparative
philology to take it almost for granted, that
after the discovery of the two families of language, the
Aryan and Semitic, and after the establishment of the
<pb n='333'/><anchor id='Pg333'/>
close ties of relationship which unite the members of
each, it would be impossible to admit any longer a
common origin of language. It was natural, after the
criteria by which the unity of the Aryan as well as the
Semitic dialects can be proved had been so successfully
defined, that the absence of similar coincidences between
any Semitic and Aryan language, or between
these and any other branch of speech, should have
led to a belief that no connection was admissible between
them. A Linnæan botanist, who has his definite
marks by which to recognize an Anemone, would reject
with equal confidence any connection between the species
Anemone and other flowers which have since been
classed under the same head though deficient in the
Linnæan marks of the Anemone.
</p>

<p>
But there are surely different degrees of affinity in
languages as well as in all other productions of
nature, and the different families of speech, though
they cannot show the same signs of relationship by
which their members are held together, need not of
necessity have been perfect strangers to each other
from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
Now I confess that when I found the argument
used over and over again, that it is impossible any
longer to speak of a common origin of language, because
comparative philology had proved that there
existed various families of language, I felt that this
was not true, that at all events it was an exaggeration.
</p>

<p>
The problem, if properly viewed, bears the following
aspect:&mdash;<q><emph>If you wish to assert that language
had various beginnings, you must prove it impossible
that language could have had a common origin.</emph></q>
</p>

<p>
No such impossibility has ever been established
<pb n='334'/><anchor id='Pg334'/>
with regard to a common origin of the Aryan and
Semitic dialects; while on the contrary the analysis
of the grammatical forms in either family has removed
many difficulties, and made it at least intelligible
how, with materials identical or very similar, two
individuals, or two families, or two nations, could in
the course of time have produced languages so different
in form as Hebrew and Sanskrit.
</p>

<p>
But still greater light was thrown on the formative
and metamorphic process of language by the study of
other dialects unconnected with Sanskrit or Hebrew,
and exhibiting before our eyes the growth of those
grammatical forms (grammatical in the widest sense
of the word) which in the Aryan and Semitic families
we know only as formed, not as forming; as decaying,
not as living; as traditional, not as understood and
intentional: I mean the Turanian languages. The
traces by which these languages attest their original
relationship are much fainter than in the Semitic
and Aryan families, but they are so of necessity.
In the Aryan and Semitic families, the agglutinative
process, by which alone grammatical forms can be
obtained, has been arrested at some time, and this
could only have been through religious or political
influences. By the same power through which an
advancing civilization absorbs the manifold dialects
in which every spoken idiom naturally represents
itself, the first political or religious centralization
must necessarily have put a check on the exuberance
of an agglutinative speech. Out of many possible
forms one became popular, fixed, and technical for
each word, for each grammatical category; and by
means of poetry, law, and religion, a literary or political
<pb n='335'/><anchor id='Pg335'/>
language was produced to which thenceforth
nothing had to be added; which in a short time,
after becoming unintelligible in its formal elements,
was liable to phonetic corruption only, but incapable
of internal resuscitation. It is necessary to admit a
primitive concentration of this kind for the Aryan
and Semitic families, for it is thus only that we can
account for coincidences between Sanskrit and Greek
terminations, which were formed neither from Greek
nor from Sanskrit materials, but which are still identically
the same in both. It is in this sense that I
call these languages political or state languages, and
it has been truly said that languages belonging to
these families must be able to prove their relationship
by sharing in common not only what is regular
and intelligible, but what is anomalous, unintelligible,
and dead.
</p>

<p>
If no such concentration takes place, languages,
though formed of the same materials and originally
identical, must necessarily diverge in what we may
call dialects, but in a very different sense from the
dialects such as we find in the later periods of political
languages. The process of agglutination will continue
in each clan, and forms becoming unintelligible will be
easily replaced by new and more intelligible compounds.
If the cases are formed by postpositions, new postpositions
can be used as soon as the old ones become obsolete.
If the conjugation is formed by pronouns, new
pronouns can be used if the old ones are no longer sufficiently
distinct.
</p>

<p>
Let us ask then, what coincidences we are likely to
find in agglutinative dialects which have become separated,
and which gradually approach to a more settled
<pb n='336'/><anchor id='Pg336'/>
state? It seems to me that we can only expect to find
in them such coincidences as Castrén and Schott have
succeeded in discovering in the Finnic, Turkic, Mongolic,
Tungusic, and Samoyedic languages; and such as
Hodgson, Caldwell, Logan, and myself have pointed out
in the Tamulic, Gangetic, Lohitic, Taïc, and Malaïc languages.
They must refer chiefly to the radical materials
of language, or to those parts of speech which it
is most difficult to reproduce, I mean pronouns, numerals,
and prepositions. These languages will hardly
ever agree in what is anomalous or inorganic, because
their organism repels continually what begins to be formal
and unintelligible. It is astonishing rather, that
any words of a conventional meaning should have
been discovered as the common property of the Turanian
languages, than that most of their words and forms
should be peculiar to each. These coincidences must,
however, be accounted for by those who deny the common
origin of the Turanian languages; they must be
accounted for, either as the result of accident, or of an
imitative instinct which led the human mind everywhere
to the same onomatopoëtic formations. This has
never been done, and it will require great efforts to
achieve it.
</p>

<p>
To myself the study of the Turanian family was interesting
particularly because it offered an opportunity
of learning how far languages, supposed to be of a common
origin, might diverge and become dissimilar by the
unrestrained operation of dialectic regeneration.
</p>

<p>
In a letter which I addressed to my friend, the late
Baron Bunsen, and which was published by him in his
<q>Outlines of the Philosophy of Universal History</q><note place='foot'>These
<q>Outlines</q> form vols. iii. and iv. of Bunsen's work,
<q>Christianity and Mankind,</q> in seven vols. (London, 1854: Longman), and are
sold separately.</note>
<pb n='337'/><anchor id='Pg337'/>
(vol. i. pp. 263-521), it had been my object to trace,
as far as I was able, the principles which guided the
formation of agglutinative languages, and to show how
far languages may become dissimilar in their grammar
and dictionary, and yet allow us to treat them as cognate
dialects. In answer to the assertion that it was
impossible, I tried, in the fourth, fifth, and sixth
sections of that Essay, to show <emph>how</emph> it was possible, that,
starting from a common ground, languages as different
as Mandshu and Finnish, Malay and Siamese, should
have arrived at their present state, and might still be
treated as cognate tongues. And as I look upon this
process of agglutination as the only intelligible means
by which language can acquire a grammatical organization,
and clear the barrier which has arrested the
growth of the Chinese idiom, I felt justified in applying
the principles derived from the formation of the
Turanian languages to the Aryan and Semitic families.
They also must have passed through an agglutinative
stage, and it is during that period alone that we can
account for the gradual divergence and individualization
of what we afterwards call the Aryan and Semitic
forms of speech. If we can account for the different
appearance of Mandshu and Finnish, we can also account
for the distance between Hebrew and Sanskrit.
It is true that we do not know the Aryan speech during
its agglutinative period, but we can infer what it
was when we see languages like Finnish and Turkish
approaching more and more to an Aryan type. Such
has been the advance which Turkish has made towards
inflectional forms, that Professor Ewald claims for it
<pb n='338'/><anchor id='Pg338'/>
the title of a synthetic language, a title which he gives
to the Aryan and Semitic dialects after they have left
the agglutinative stage, and entered into a process of
phonetic corruption and dissolution. <q>Many of its
component parts,</q> he says, <q>though they were no
doubt originally, as in every language, independent
words, have been reduced to mere vowels, or have
been lost altogether, so that we must infer their former
presence by the changes which they have wrought
in the body of the word. <emph>Göz</emph> means eye, and <emph>gör</emph>,
to see; <emph>ish</emph>, deed, and <emph>ir</emph>, to do;
<emph>îtsh</emph>, the interior, <emph>gîr</emph>,
to enter.</q><note place='foot'>Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen,
1855, p. 298.</note> Nay, he goes so far as to admit some
formal elements which Turkish shares in common with
the Aryan family, and which therefore could only date
from a period when both were still in their agglutinative
infancy. For instance, <emph>di</emph>, as exponent of a past
action; <emph>ta</emph>, as the sign of the past participle of the passive;
<emph>lu</emph>, as a suffix to form adjectives,
&amp;c.<note place='foot'>Ibid., p. 302, note.</note> This is
more than I should venture to assert.
</p>

<p>
Taking this view of the gradual formation of language
by agglutination, as opposed to intussusception,
it is hardly necessary to say that, if I speak of a
Turanian family of speech, I use the word family in a
different sense from that which it has with regard to
the Aryan and Semitic languages. In my Letter on
the Turanian languages, which has been the subject of
such fierce attacks from those who believe in different
beginnings of language and mankind, I had explained
this repeatedly, and I had preferred the term of <emph>group</emph>
for the Turanian languages, in order to express as
clearly as possible that the relation between Turkish
<pb n='339'/><anchor id='Pg339'/>
and Mandshu, between Tamil and Finnish, was a different
one, not in degree only, but in kind, from that
between Sanskrit and Greek. <q>These Turanian languages,</q>
I said (p. 216), <q>cannot be considered as
standing to each other in the same relation as Hebrew
and Arabic, Sanskrit and Greek.</q> <q>They are radii
diverging from a common centre, not children of a
common parent.</q> And still they are not so widely
distant as Hebrew and Sanskrit, because none of them
has entered into that new phase of growth or decay
(p. 218) through which the Semitic and Aryan languages
passed after they had been settled, individualized,
and nationalized.
</p>

<p>
The real object of my Essay was therefore a defensive
one. It was to show how rash it was to speak of
different independent beginnings in the history of human
speech, before a single argument had been brought
forward to establish the necessity of such an admission.
The impossibility of a common origin of language has
never been proved, but, in order to remove what were
considered difficulties affecting the theory of a common
origin, I felt it my duty to show practically, and by the
very history of the Turanian languages, how such a
theory was possible, or as I say in one instance only,
probable. I endeavored to show how even the most distant
members of the Turanian family, the one spoken
in the north, the other in the south of Asia, the <emph>Finnic</emph>
and the <emph>Tamulic</emph>, have preserved in their grammatical
organization traces of a former unity; and, if my opponents
admit that I have proved the ante-Brahmanic
or Tamulic inhabitants of India to belong to the Turanian
family, they can hardly have been aware that if
this, the most extreme point of my argument be conceded,
<pb n='340'/><anchor id='Pg340'/>
everything else is involved, and must follow by
necessity.
</p>

<p>
Yet I did not call the last chapter of my Essay,
<q>On the Necessity of a common origin of Language,</q>
but <q>On the Possibility;</q> and, in answer to the
opinions advanced by the opposite party, I summed up
my defence in these two paragraphs:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend='display'>
<p>
I.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing necessitates the admission of different independent
beginnings for the <emph>material</emph> elements of the
Turanian, Semitic, and Aryan branches of speech;&mdash;nay,
it is possible even now to point out radicals
which, under various changes and disguises, have been
current in these three branches ever since their first
separation.</q>
</p>

<p>
II.
</p>

<p>
<q>Nothing necessitates the admission of different
beginnings for the formal elements of the Turanian,
Semitic, and Aryan branches of speech;&mdash;and though
it is impossible to derive the Aryan system of grammar
from the Semitic, or the Semitic from the Aryan,
we can perfectly understand how, either through individual
influences, or by the wear and tear of speech in
its own continuous working, the different systems of
grammar of Asia and Europe may have been produced.</q>
</p>
</quote>

<p>
It will be seen, from the very wording of these two
paragraphs, that my object was to deny the necessity
of independent beginnings, and to assert the possibility
of a common origin of language. I have been accused
<pb n='341'/><anchor id='Pg341'/>
of having been biassed in my researches by an implicit
belief in the common origin of mankind. I do not
deny that I hold this belief, and, if it wanted confirmation,
that confirmation has been supplied by Darwin's
book <q>On the Origin of Species.</q><note place='foot'><p><q>Here the
lines converge as they recede into the geological ages, and
point to conclusions which, upon Darwin's theory, are inevitable, but hardly
welcome. The very first step backward makes the negro and the Hottentot
our blood-relations; not that reason or Scripture objects to that, though
pride may.</q> Asa Gray, <q>Natural Selection not inconsistent with Natural
Theology,</q> 1861, p. 5.
</p>
<p>
<q>One good effect is already manifest, its enabling the advocates of the
hypothesis of a multiplicity of human species to perceive the double insecurity
of their ground. When the races of men are admitted to be of one
species, the corollary, that they are of one origin, may be expected to follow.
Those who allow them to be of one species must admit an actual
diversification into strongly marked and persistent varieties; while those,
on the other hand, who recognize several or numerous human species, will
hardly be able to maintain that such species were primordial and supernatural
in the ordinary sense of the word.</q> Asa Gray, Nat. Sel. p. 54.</p></note> But I defy my
adversaries to point out one single passage where I
have mixed up scientific with theological arguments.
Only if I am told that no <q>quiet observer would ever
have conceived the idea of deriving all mankind from
one pair, unless the Mosaic records had taught it,</q> I
must be allowed to say in reply, that this idea on the
contrary is so natural, so consistent with all human
laws of reasoning, that, as far as I know, there has
been no nation on earth which, if it possessed any traditions
on the origin of mankind, did not derive the
human race from one pair, if not from one person.
The author of the Mosaic records, therefore, though
stripped, before the tribunal of Physical Science, of his
claims as an inspired writer, may at least claim the
modest title of a quiet observer, and if his conception
of the physical unity of the human race can be proved
to be an error, it is an error which he shares in common
<pb n='342'/><anchor id='Pg342'/>
with other quiet observers, such as Humboldt,
Bunsen, Prichard, and Owen.<note place='foot'>Professor Pott,
the most distinguished advocate of the polygenetic dogma,
has pleaded the necessity of admitting more than one beginning for the
human race and for language in an article in the Journal of the German
Oriental Society, ix. 405, <q>Max Müller und die Kennzeichen der Sprachverwandtschaft,</q>
1855; in a treatise <q>Die Ungleichheit menschlicher Rassen,</q>
1856; and in the new edition of his <q>Etymologische Forschungen,</q>
1861.</note>
</p>

<p>
The only question which remains to be answered is
this, Was it one and the same volume of water which
supplied all the lateral channels of speech? or, to drop
all metaphor, are the roots which were joined together
according to the radical, the terminational, and inflectional
systems, identically the same? The only way to
answer, or at least to dispose of, this question is to consider
the nature and origin of roots; and we shall then
have reached the extreme limits to which inductive
reasoning can carry us in our researches into the mysteries
of human speech.

<p>
<q>In examining the history of mankind, as well as in
examining the phenomena of the material world, when
we cannot trace the process by which an event <emph>has been</emph>
produced, it is often of importance to be able to show
how it <emph>may have been</emph> produced by natural causes. Thus,
although it is impossible to determine with certainty
what the steps were by which any particular language
was formed, yet if we can show, from the known principles
of human nature, how all its various parts <emph>might</emph>
gradually have arisen, the mind is not only to a certain
degree satisfied, but a check is given to that indolent
philosophy which refers to a miracle whatever appearances,
both in the natural and moral worlds, it is unable
to explain.</q><note place='foot'>Dugald Stewart, vol. iii. p. 35.</note>
</p>

<p>
This quotation from an eminent Scotch philosopher
contains the best advice that could be given to the student
of the science of language, when he approaches
the problem which we have to examine to-day, namely,
the origin of language. Though we have stripped that
problem of the perplexing and mysterious aspect which
it presented to the philosophers of old, yet, even in its
simplest form, it seems to be almost beyond the reach
of the human understanding.
</p>

<pb n='344'/><anchor id='Pg344'/>

<p>
If we were asked the riddle how images of the eye
and all the sensations of our senses could be represented
by sounds, nay, could be so embodied in sounds
as to express thought and excite thought, we should
probably give it up as the question of a madman, who,
mixing up the most heterogeneous subjects, attempted
to change color into sound and sound into thought.<note place='foot'>Herder,
as quoted by Steinthal, <q>Ursprung der Sprache,</q> s. 39.</note>
Yet this is the riddle which we have now to solve.
</p>

<p>
It is quite clear that we have no means of solving the
problem of the origin of language <emph>historically</emph>, or of explaining
it as a matter of fact which happened once in
a certain locality and at a certain time. History does
not begin till long after mankind had acquired the
power of language, and even the most ancient traditions
are silent as to the manner in which man came in possession
of his earliest thoughts and words. Nothing,
no doubt, would be more interesting than to know
from historical documents the exact process by which
the first man began to lisp his first words, and thus to
be rid forever of all the theories on the origin of speech.
But this knowledge is denied us; and, if it had been
otherwise, we should probably be quite unable to understand
those primitive events in the history of the
human mind.<note place='foot'><q>In all these paths of research, when we travel far
backwards the aspect of the earlier portions becomes very different from that of the
advanced part on which we now stand; but in all cases the path is lost in
obscurity as it is traced backwards towards its starting point:&mdash;it becomes
not only invisible, but unimaginable; it is not only an interruption, but an
abyss, which interposes itself between us and any intelligible beginning of
things.</q> Whewell, Indications, p. 166.</note> We are told that the first man was the
son of God, that God created him in His own image,
formed him of the dust of the ground, and breathed
into his nostrils the breath of life. These are simple
<pb n='345'/><anchor id='Pg345'/>
facts, and to be accepted as such; if we begin to reason
on them, the edge of the human understanding glances
off. Our mind is so constituted that it cannot apprehend
the absolute beginning or the absolute end of
anything. If we tried to conceive the first man created
as a child, and gradually unfolding his physical and
mental powers, we could not understand his living for
<emph>one</emph> day without supernatural aid. If, on the contrary,
we tried to conceive the first man created full-grown in
body and mind, the conception of an effect without a
cause, of a full-grown mind without a previous growth,
would equally transcend our reasoning powers. It is
the same with the first beginnings of language. Theologians
who claim for language a divine origin drift into
the most dangerous anthropomorphism, when they enter
into any details as to the manner in which they
suppose the Deity to have compiled a dictionary and
grammar in order to teach them to the first man, as a
schoolmaster teaches the deaf and dumb. And they do
not see that, even if all their premises were granted,
they would have explained no more than how the first
man might have learnt a language, if there was a language
ready made for him. How that language was
made would remain as great a mystery as ever. Philosophers,
on the contrary, who imagine that the first man,
though left to himself, would gradually have emerged
from a state of mutism and have invented words for
every new conception that arose in his mind, forget
that man could not by his own power have acquired <emph>the
faculty</emph> of speech which is the distinctive character of
mankind,<note place='foot'><q>Der Mensch ist nur Mensch durch Sprache; um aber die
Sprache zu erfinden, müsste er schon Mensch sein.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>W. von
Humboldt, Sämmtliche
Werke</hi>, b. iii. s. 252. The same argument is ridden to death by Süssmilch,
<q>Versuch eines Beweises dass die erste Sprache ihrem Ursprung nicht
vom Menschen, sondern allein vom Schöpfer erhalten
habe.</q> Berlin, 1766.</note> unattained and unattainable by the mute
<pb n='346'/><anchor id='Pg346'/>
creation. It shows a want of appreciation as to the
real bearings of our problem, if philosophers appeal to
the fact that children are born without language, and
gradually emerge from mutism to the full command of
articulate speech. We want no explanation how birds
learn to fly, created as they are with organs adapted to
that purpose. Nor do we wish to inquire how children
learn to use the various faculties with which the human
body and soul are endowed. We want to gain, if possible,
an insight into the original faculty of speech; and
for that purpose I fear it is as useless to watch the first
stammerings of children, as it would be to repeat the
experiment of the Egyptian king who intrusted two
new-born infants to a shepherd, with the injunction to
let them suck a goat's milk, and to speak no word in
their presence, but to observe what word they would
first utter.<note place='foot'>Farrar, Origin of Language, p.
10; Grimm, Ursprung der Sprache, s. 32.
The word βεκός, which these children are reported to have uttered, and
which, in the Phrygian language, meant bread, thus proving, it was supposed,
that the Phrygian was the primitive language of mankind, is derived
from the same root which exists in the English, to bake. How these
unfortunate children came by the idea of baked bread, involving the ideas
of corn, mill, oven, fire, &amp;c., seems never to have struck the ancient sages
of Egypt.</note> The same experiment is said to have been
repeated by the Swabian emperor, Frederic II., by
James IV. of Scotland, and by one of the Mogul emperors
of India. But, whether for the purpose of finding
out which was the primitive language of mankind,
or of discovering how far language was natural to man,
the experiments failed to throw any light on the problem
before us. Children, in learning to speak, do not
invent language. Language is there ready made for
<pb n='347'/><anchor id='Pg347'/>
them. It has been there for thousands of years. They
acquire the use of a language, and, as they grow up,
they may acquire the use of a second and a third. It
is useless to inquire whether infants, left to themselves,
would invent a language. It would be impossible, unnatural,
and illegal to try the experiment, and, without
repeated experiments, the assertions of those who believe
and those who disbelieve the possibility of children inventing
a language of their own, are equally valueless.
All we know for certain is, that an English child, if
left to itself, would never begin to speak English, and
that history supplies no instance of any language having
thus been invented.
</p>

<p>
If we want to gain an insight into the faculty of
flying, which is a characteristic feature of birds, all
we can do is, first, to compare the structure of birds
with that of other animals which are devoid of that
faculty, and secondly, to examine the conditions under
which the act of flying becomes possible. It is the
same with speech. Speech is a specific faculty of man.
It distinguishes man from all other creatures; and if
we wish to acquire more definite ideas as to the real
nature of human speech, all we can do is to compare
man with those animals that seem to come nearest to
him, and thus to try to discover what he shares in
common with these animals, and what is peculiar to
him and to him alone. After we have discovered this,
we may proceed to inquire into the conditions under
which speech becomes possible, and we shall then have
done all that we can do, considering that the instruments
of our knowledge, wonderful as they are, are
yet far too weak to carry us into all the regions to
which we may soar on the wings of our imagination.
</p>

<pb n='348'/><anchor id='Pg348'/>

<p>
In comparing man with the other animals, we need
not enter here into the physiological questions whether
the difference between the body of an ape and the body
of a man is one of degree or of kind. However that
question is settled by physiologists we need not be
afraid. If the structure of a mere worm is such as
to fill the human mind with awe, if a single glimpse
which we catch of the infinite wisdom displayed in the
organs of the lowest creature gives us an intimation of
the wisdom of its Divine Creator far transcending the
powers of our conception, how are we to criticise and
disparage the most highly organized creatures of His
creation, creatures as wonderfully made as we ourselves?
Are there not many creatures on many points
more perfect even than man? Do we not envy the
lion's strength, the eagle's eye, the wings of every
bird? If there existed animals altogether as perfect
as man in their physical structure, nay, even more perfect,
no thoughtful man would ever be uneasy. His
true superiority rests on different grounds. <q>I confess,</q>
Sydney Smith writes, <q>I feel myself so much
at ease about the superiority of mankind&mdash;I have
such a marked and decided contempt for the understanding
of every baboon I have ever seen&mdash;I feel
so sure that the blue ape without a tail will never
rival us in poetry, painting, and music, that I see no
reason whatever that justice may not be done to the
few fragments of soul and tatters of understanding
which they may really possess.</q> The playfulness of
Sydney Smith in handling serious and sacred subjects
has of late been found fault with by many: but humor
is a safer sign of strong convictions and perfect
safety than guarded solemnity.
</p>

<pb n='349'/><anchor id='Pg349'/>

<p>
With regard to our own problem, no one can doubt
that certain animals possess all the physical requirements
for articulate speech. There is no letter of the
alphabet which a parrot will not learn to pronounce.<note place='foot'><q>L'usage
de la main, la marche à deux pieds, la ressemblance, quoique
grossière, de la face, tous les actes qui peuvent résulter de cette conformité
d'organisation, ont fait donner au singe le nom d'<emph>homme sauvage</emph>, par des
homines à la vérité qui l'étaient à demi, et qui ne savaient comparer que
les rapports extérieurs. Que serait-ce, si, par une combinaison de nature
aussi possible que toute autre, le singe eût eu la voix du perroquet, et,
comme lui, la faculté de la parole? Le singe parlant eût rendu muette
d'étonnement l'espèce humaine entière, et l'aurait séduite au point que le
philosophe aurait eu grand'peine à démontrer qu'avec tous ces beaux
attributs humains le singe n'en était pas moins une bête. Il est donc
heureux, pour notre intelligence, que la nature ait séparé et placé, dans
deux espèces très-différentes, l'imitation de la parole et celle de nos
gestes.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Buffon</hi>, as quoted by Flourens, p. 77.</note>
The fact, therefore, that the parrot is without a language
of his own, must be explained by a difference
between the <emph>mental</emph>, not between the <emph>physical</emph>, faculties
of the animal and man; and it is by a comparison of
the mental faculties alone, such as we find them in
man and brutes, that we may hope to discover what
constitutes the indispensable qualification for language,
a qualification to be found in man alone, and in no
other creature on earth.
</p>

<p>
I say <emph>mental faculties</emph>, and I mean to claim a large
share of what we call our mental faculties for the
higher animals. These animals have <emph>sensation</emph>, <emph>perception</emph>,
<emph>memory</emph>, <emph>will</emph>, and <emph>intellect</emph>, only we must restrict
intellect to the comparing or interlacing of single
perceptions. All these points can be proved by irrefragable
evidence, and that evidence has never, I believe,
been summed up with greater lucidity and power
than in one of the last publications of M. P. Flourens,
<q>De la Raison, du Génie, et de la Folie:</q> Paris,
<pb n='350'/><anchor id='Pg350'/>
1861. There are no doubt many people who are as
much frightened at the idea that brutes have souls and
are able to think, as by <q>the blue ape without a tail.</q>
But their fright is entirely of their own making. If
people will use such words as soul or thought without
making it clear to themselves and others what they
mean by them, these words will slip away under their
feet, and the result must be painful. If we once ask
the question, Have brutes a soul? we shall never arrive
at any conclusion; for <emph>soul</emph> has been so many times
defined by philosophers from Aristotle down to Hegel,
that it means everything and nothing. Such has been
the confusion caused by the promiscuous employment
of the ill-defined terms of mental philosophy that we
find Descartes representing brutes as living machines,
whereas Leibniz claims for them not only souls, but
immortal souls. <q>Next to the error of those who
deny the existence of God,</q> says Descartes, <q>there
is none so apt to lead weak minds from the right path
of virtue, as to think that the soul of brutes is of the
same nature as our own; and, consequently, that we
have nothing to fear or to hope after this life, any more
than flies or ants; whereas, if we know how much they
differ, we understand much better that <emph>our</emph> soul is quite
independent of the body, and consequently not subject
to die with the body.</q>
</p>

<p>
The spirit of these remarks is excellent, but the argument
is extremely weak. It does not follow that
brutes have no souls because they have no human
souls. It does not follow that the souls of men are
not immortal, because the souls of brutes are not immortal;
nor has the <emph>major premiss</emph> ever been proved by
any philosopher, namely, that the souls of brutes must
<pb n='351'/><anchor id='Pg351'/>
necessarily be destroyed and annihilated by death.
Leibniz, who has defended the immortality of the human
soul with stronger arguments than even Descartes,
writes:&mdash;<q>I found at last how the souls of brutes and
their sensations do not at all interfere with the immortality
of human souls; on the contrary, nothing serves
better to establish our natural immortality than to believe
that all souls are imperishable.</q>
</p>

<p>
Instead of entering into these perplexities, which are
chiefly due to the loose employment of ill-defined terms,
let us simply look at the facts. Every unprejudiced
observer will admit that&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. Brutes see, hear, taste, smell, and feel; that is to
say, they have five senses, just like ourselves, neither
more nor less. They have both sensation and perception,
a point which has been illustrated by M. Flourens
by the most interesting experiments. If the roots of
the optic nerve are removed, the retina in the eye of
a bird ceases to be excitable, the iris is no longer movable;
the animal is blind, because it has lost the organ
of <emph>sensation</emph>. If, on the contrary, the cerebral lobes are
removed, the eye remains pure and sound, the retina
excitable, the iris movable. The eye is preserved, yet
the animal cannot see, because it has lost the organs of
<emph>perception</emph>.
</p>

<p>
2. Brutes have sensations of pleasure and pain. A
dog that is beaten behaves exactly like a child that is
chastised, and a dog that is fed and fondled exhibits the
same signs of satisfaction as a boy under the same circumstances.
We can only judge from signs, and if
they are to be trusted in the case of children, they
must be trusted likewise in the case of brutes.
</p>

<p>
3. Brutes do not forget, or as philosophers would
<pb n='352'/><anchor id='Pg352'/>
say, brutes have memory. They know their masters,
they know their home; they evince joy on recognizing
those who have been kind to them, and they bear
malice for years to those by whom they have been insulted
or ill-treated. Who does not recollect the dog
Argos in the Odyssey, who, after so many years' absence,
was the first to recognize Ulysses?<note place='foot'>Odyssey, xvii. 300.</note>
</p>

<p>
4. Brutes are able to compare and to distinguish.
A parrot will take up a nut, and throw it down again,
without attempting to crack it. He has found that it
is light; this he could discover only by comparing the
weight of the good nuts with that of the bad: and he
has found that it has no kernel; this he could discover
only by what philosophers would dignify with the
grand title of syllogism, namely, <q>all light nuts are
hollow; this is a light nut, therefore this nut is hollow.</q>
</p>

<p>
5. Brutes have a will of their own. I appeal to any
one who has ever ridden a restive horse.
</p>

<p>
6. Brutes show signs of shame and pride. Here
again any one who has to deal with dogs, who has
watched a retriever with sparkling eyes placing a partridge
at his master's feet, or a hound slinking away
with his tail between his legs from the huntsman's
call, will agree that these signs admit of but one interpretation.
The difficulty begins when we use philosophical
language, when we claim for brutes a moral
sense, a conscience, a power of distinguishing good and
evil; and, as we gain nothing by these scholastic terms,
it is better to avoid them altogether.
</p>

<p>
7. Brutes show signs of love and hatred. There
are well-authenticated stories of dogs following their
<pb n='353'/><anchor id='Pg353'/>
masters to the grave, and refusing food from any one.
Nor is there any doubt that brutes will watch their
opportunity till they revenge themselves on those whom
they dislike.
</p>

<p>
If, with all these facts before us, we deny that brutes
have sensation, perception, memory, will, and intellect,
we ought to bring forward powerful arguments for interpreting
the signs which we observe in brutes so differently
from those which we observe in men.
</p>

<p>
Some philosophers imagine they have explained everything,
if they ascribe to brutes <emph>instinct</emph> instead of
<emph>intellect</emph>. But, if we take these two words in their
usual acceptations, they surely do not exclude each
other.<note place='foot'><q>The evident marks of
reasoning in the other animals,&mdash;of reasoning
which I cannot but think as unquestionable as the instincts that mingle
with it.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Brown, Works</hi>, vol. i.
p. 446.</note> There are instincts in man as well as in brutes.
A child takes his mother's breast by instinct; the
spider weaves its net by instinct; the bee builds her
cell by instinct. No one would ascribe to the child a
knowledge of physiology because it employs the exact
muscles which are required for sucking; nor shall we
claim for the spider a knowledge of mechanics, or for
the bee an acquaintance with geometry, because <emph>we</emph>
could not do what they do without a study of these
sciences. But what if we tear a spider's web, and see
the spider examining the mischief that is done, and
either giving up his work in despair, or endeavoring to
mend it as well as may be?<note place='foot'>Flourens,
De la Raison, p. 51.</note> Surely here we have
the instinct of weaving controlled by observation,
by comparison, by reflection, by judgment. Instinct,
whether mechanical or moral, is more prominent in
<pb n='354'/><anchor id='Pg354'/>
brutes than in man; but it exists in both, as much as
intellect is shared by both.
</p>

<p>
Where, then, is the difference between brute and
man?<note place='foot'>To allow that <q>brutes have certain mental endowments in common
with men,</q> ... <q>desires, affections, memory, simple imagination, or the
power of reproducing the sensible past in mental pictures, and even judgment
of the simple or intuition kind;</q>&mdash;that <q>they compare and judge,</q>
(Mem. Amer. Acad. 8, p. 118,)&mdash;is to concede that the intellect of brutes
really acts, so far as we know, like human intellect, as far as it goes; for
the philosophical logicians tell us that all reasoning is reducible to a series
of simple judgments. And Aristotle declares that even reminiscence,&mdash;which
is, we suppose, <q>reproducing the sensible past in mental pictures,</q>&mdash;is
a sort of reasoning (τὶ ἀναμιμνήσκεσθαί ἐστι οἱον συλλογισμός τισ.)
Asa Gray, Natural Selection, &amp;c., p. 58, <hi rend='italic'>note</hi>.</note>
What is it that man can do, and of which
we find no signs, no rudiments, in the whole brute
world? I answer without hesitation: the one great
barrier between the brute and man is <emph>Language</emph>. Man
speaks, and no brute has ever uttered a word. Language
is our Rubicon, and no brute will dare to cross
it. This is our matter of fact answer to those who
speak of development, who think they discover the rudiments
at least of all human faculties in apes, and who
would fain keep open the possibility that man is only
a more favored beast, the triumphant conqueror in the
primeval struggle for life. Language is something
more palpable than a fold of the brain, or an angle of
the skull. It admits of no cavilling, and no process of
natural selection will ever distill significant words out
of the notes of birds or the cries of beasts.
</p>

<p>
Language, however, is only the outward sign. We
may point to it in our arguments, we may challenge
our opponent to produce anything approaching to it
from the whole brute world. But if this were all, if
the art of employing articulate sounds for the purpose
of communicating our impressions were the only thing
<pb n='355'/><anchor id='Pg355'/>
by which we could assert our superiority over the
brute creation, we might not unreasonably feel somewhat
uneasy at having the gorilla so close on our
heels.
</p>

<p>
It cannot be denied that brutes, though they do not
use articulate sounds for that purpose, have nevertheless
means of their own for communicating with each
other. When a whale is struck, the whole shoal,
though widely dispersed, are instantly made aware of
the presence of an enemy; and when the grave-digger
beetle finds the carcass of a mole, he hastens to communicate
the discovery to his fellows, and soon returns
with his <emph>four</emph> confederates.<note place='foot'>Conscience,
Boek der Natuer, vi., quoted by Marsh, p. 32.</note> It is evident, too, that
dogs, though they do not speak, possess the power of
understanding much that is said to them, their names
and the calls of their master; and other animals, such
as the parrot, can pronounce every articulate sound.
Hence, although for the purpose of philosophical warfare,
articulate language would still form an impregnable
position, yet it is but natural that for our own satisfaction
we should try to find out in what the strength
of our position really consists; or, in other words, that
we should try to discover that inward power of which
language is the outward sign and manifestation.
</p>

<p>
For this purpose it will be best to examine the
opinions of those who approached our problem from
another point; who, instead of looking for outward
and palpable signs of difference between brute and
man, inquired into the inward mental faculties, and
tried to determine the point where man transcends
the barriers of the brute intellect. That point, if
truly determined, ought to coincide with the starting-point
<pb n='356'/><anchor id='Pg356'/>
of language: and, if so, that coincidence ought
to explain the problem which occupies us at present.
</p>

<p>
I shall read an extract from Locke's Essay concerning
Human Understanding.
</p>

<p>
After having explained how universal ideas are
made, how the mind, having observed the same color
in chalk, and snow, and milk, comprehends these single
perceptions under the general conception of whiteness,
Locke continues:<note place='foot'>Book ii. chapter xi.
§ 10.</note> <q>If it may be doubted, whether
beasts compound and enlarge their ideas that way to
any degree: this, I think, I may be positive in, that
the power of abstracting is not at all in them; and
that the having of general ideas is that which puts a
perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes, and is an
excellency which the faculties of brutes do by no
means attain to.</q>
</p>

<p>
If Locke is right in considering the having general
ideas as the distinguishing feature between man and
brutes, and, if we ourselves are right in pointing to
language as the one palpable distinction between the
two, it would seem to follow that language is the outward
sign and realization of that inward faculty which
is called the faculty of abstraction, but which is better
known to us by the homely name of Reason.
</p>

<p>
Let us now look back to the result of our former
Lectures. It was this. After we had explained everything
in the growth of language that can be explained,
there remained in the end, as the only inexplicable residuum,
what we called <emph>roots</emph>. These roots formed the
constituent elements of all languages. This discovery
has simplified the problem of the origin of language
immensely. It has taken away all excuse for those
<pb n='357'/><anchor id='Pg357'/>
rapturous descriptions of language which invariably
preceded the argument that language must have a
divine origin. We shall hear no more of that wonderful
instrument which can express all we see, and
hear, and taste, and touch, and smell; which is the
breathing image of the whole world; which gives form
to the airy feelings of our souls, and body to the loftiest
dreams of our imagination; which can arrange in accurate
perspective the past, the present, and the future,
and throw over everything the varying hues of certainty,
of doubt, of contingency. All this is perfectly
true, but it is no longer wonderful, at least not in the
Arabian Nights sense of that word. <q>The speculative
mind,</q> as Dr. Ferguson says, <q>in comparing the first
and last steps of the progress of language, feels the
same sort of amazement with a traveller, who, after
rising insensibly on the slope of a hill, comes to look
from a precipice of an almost unfathomable depth to
the summit of which he scarcely believes himself to
have ascended without supernatural aid.</q> To certain
minds it is a disappointment to be led down again by
the hand of history from that high summit. They
prefer the unintelligible which they can admire, to the
intelligible which they can only understand. But to a
mature mind reality is more attractive than fiction, and
simplicity more wonderful than complication. Roots
may seem dry things as compared with the poetry of
Goethe. Yet there is something more truly wonderful
in a root than in all the lyrics of the world.
</p>

<p>
What, then, are these roots? In our modern languages
roots can only be discovered by scientific analysis,
and, even as far back as Sanskrit, we may say
that no root was ever used as a noun or as a verb.
<pb n='358'/><anchor id='Pg358'/>
But originally roots were thus used, and in Chinese we
have fortunately preserved to us a representative of
that primitive radical stage which, like the granite,
underlies all other strata of human speech. The
Aryan root <emph>DÂ</emph>, to give, appears in Sanskrit <emph>dâ-nam</emph>,
<emph>donum</emph>, gift, as a substantive; in <emph>do</emph>,
Sanskrit <emph>dadâmi</emph>,
Greek <emph>di-dō-mi</emph>, I give, as a verb; but the root DÂ
can never be used by itself. In Chinese, on the contrary,
the root TA, as such, is used in the sense of a
noun, greatness; of a verb, to be great; of an adverb,
greatly or much. Roots therefore are not, as is commonly
maintained, merely scientific abstractions, but
they were used originally as real words. What we
want to find out is this, What inward mental phase
is it that corresponds to these roots, as the germs of
human speech?
</p>

<p>
Two theories have been started to solve this problem,
which, for shortness' sake, I shall call the <emph>Bow-wow
theory</emph> and the <emph>Pooh-pooh theory</emph>.<note place='foot'>I
regret to find that the expressions here used have given offence to
several of my reviewers. They were used because the names Onomatopoetic
and Interjectional are awkward and not very clear. They were not
intended to be disrespectful to those who hold the one or the other theory,
some of them scholars for whose achievements in comparative philology I
entertain the most sincere respect.</note>
</p>

<p>
According to the first, roots are imitations of sounds,
according to the second, they are involuntary interjections.
The first theory was very popular among the
philosophers of the eighteenth century, and, as it is still
held by many distinguished scholars and philosophers,
we must examine it more carefully. It is supposed
then that man, being as yet mute, heard the voices of
birds and dogs and cows, the thunder of the clouds,
the roaring of the sea, the rustling of the forest, the
<pb n='359'/><anchor id='Pg359'/>
murmurs of the brook, and the whisper of the breeze.
He tried to imitate these sounds, and finding his
mimicking cries useful as signs of the objects from
which they proceeded, he followed up the idea and
elaborated language. This view was most ably defended
by Herder.<note place='foot'>A fuller account of
the views of Herder and other philosophers on the
origin of language may be found in Steinthal's useful little work, <q>Der
Ursprung der Sprache:</q> Berlin, 1853.</note> <q>Man,</q> he says, <q>shows conscious
reflection when his soul acts so freely that it
may separate, in the ocean of sensations which rush
into it through the senses, one single wave, arrest it,
regard it, being conscious all the time of regarding this
one single wave. Man proves his conscious reflection
when, out of the dream of images that float past his
senses, he can gather himself up and wake for a moment,
dwelling intently on one image, fixing it with a
bright and tranquil glance, and discovering for himself
those signs by which he knows that <emph>this</emph> is <emph>this</emph> image
and no other. Man proves his conscious reflection
when he not only perceives vividly and distinctly all
the features of an object, but is able to separate and
recognize one or more of them as its distinguishing
features.</q> For instance, <q>Man sees a lamb. He
does not see it like the ravenous wolf. He is not
disturbed by any uncontrollable instinct. He wants
to know it, but he is neither drawn towards it nor
repelled from it by his senses. The lamb stands before
him, as represented by his senses, white, soft,
woolly. The conscious and reflecting soul of man
looks for a distinguishing mark;&mdash;the lamb bleats!&mdash;the
mark is found. The bleating which made the
strongest impression, which stood apart from all other
<pb n='360'/><anchor id='Pg360'/>
impressions of sight or touch, remains in the soul.
The lamb returns&mdash;white, soft, woolly. The soul
sees, touches, reflects, looks for a mark. The lamb
bleats, and now the soul has recognized it. <q>Ah,
thou art the bleating animal,</q> the soul says within
herself; and the sound of bleating, perceived as the
distinguishing mark of the lamb, becomes the name
of the lamb. It was the comprehended mark, the
word. And what is the whole of our language but
a collection of such words?</q>
</p>

<p>
Our answer is, that though there are names in
every language formed by mere imitation of sound, yet
these constitute a very small proportion of our dictionary.
They are the playthings, not the tools, of language,
and any attempt to reduce the most common
and necessary words to imitative roots ends in complete
failure. Herder himself, after having most strenuously
defended this theory of Onomatopoieia, as it is called,
and having gained a prize which the Berlin Academy
had offered for the best essay on the origin of language,
renounced it openly towards the latter years of his life,
and threw himself in despair into the arms of those
who looked upon languages as miraculously revealed.
We cannot deny the possibility that <emph>a</emph> language might
have been formed on the principle of imitation; all we
say is, that as yet no language has been discovered
that was so formed. An Englishman in China,<note place='foot'>Farrar, p. 74.</note> seeing
a dish placed before him about which he felt
suspicious, and wishing to know whether it was a
duck, said, with an interrogative accent,
</p>

<p>
<emph>Quack quack?</emph>
</p>

<p>
He received the clear and straightforward answer,
</p>

<p>
<emph>Bow-wow!</emph>
</p>

<pb n='361'/><anchor id='Pg361'/>

<p>
This, no doubt, was as good as the most eloquent
conversation on the same subject between an Englishman
and a French waiter. But I doubt whether it
deserves the name of language. We do not speak of
a <emph>bow-wow</emph>, but of a dog. We speak of a cow, not of
a <emph>moo</emph>. Of a lamb, not of a <emph>baa</emph>. It is the same in
more ancient languages, such as Greek, Latin, and
Sanskrit. If this principle of Onomatopoieia is applicable
anywhere, it would be in the formation of the
names of animals. Yet we listen in vain for any similarity
between goose and cackling, hen and clucking,
duck and quacking, sparrow and chirping, dove and
cooing, hog and grunting, cat and mewing, between
dog and barking, yelping, snarling, or growling.
</p>

<p>
There are of course some names, such as <emph>cuckoo</emph>,
which are clearly formed by an imitation of sound.
But words of this kind are, like artificial flowers,
without a root. They are sterile, and are unfit to
express anything beyond the one object which they
imitate. If you remember the variety of derivatives
that could be formed from the root <emph>spac</emph>, to see, you
will at once perceive the difference between the fabrication
of such a word as <emph>cuckoo</emph>, and the true natural
growth of words.
</p>

<p>
Let us compare two words such as <emph>cuckoo</emph> and
<emph>raven</emph>. <emph>Cuckoo</emph> in English is clearly a mere imitation
of the cry of that bird, even more so than the corresponding
terms in Greek, Sanskrit, and Latin. In
these languages the imitative element has received the
support of a derivative suffix; we have <emph>kokila</emph> in Sanskrit,
and <emph>kokkyx</emph> in Greek, <emph>cuculus</emph> in
Latin.<note place='foot'>Pott, Etymologische Forschungen, i. 87; Zeitschrift,
iii. 43.</note> <emph>Cuckoo</emph>
is, in fact, a modern word, which has taken the place
<pb n='362'/><anchor id='Pg362'/>
of the Anglo-Saxon <emph>geac</emph>, the German <emph>Gauch</emph>, and,
being purely onomatopoëtic, it is of course not liable
to the changes of Grimm's Law. As the word <emph>cuckoo</emph>
predicates nothing but the sound of a particular bird, it
could never be applied for expressing any general quality
in which other animals might share; and the only
derivatives to which it might give rise are words expressive
of a metaphorical likeness with the bird. The
same applies to <emph>cock</emph>, the Sanskrit <emph>kukkuṭa</emph>. Here, too,
Grimm's Law does not apply, for both words were
intended to convey merely the cackling sound of the
bird; and, as this intention continued to be felt,
phonetic change was less likely to set in. The Sanskrit
<emph>kukkuṭa</emph> is not derived from any root, it simply repeats
the cry of the bird, and the only derivatives to which
it gives rise are metaphorical expressions, such as the
French <emph>coquet</emph>, originally strutting about like a cock;
<emph>coquetterie</emph>; <emph>cocart</emph>, conceited;
<emph>cocarde</emph>, a cockade; <emph>coquelicot</emph>,
originally a cock's comb, then the wild red
poppy, likewise so called from its similarity with a
cock's comb.
</p>

<p>
Let us now examine the word <emph>raven</emph>. It might
seem at first, as if this also was merely onomatopoëtic.
Some people imagine they perceive a kind
of similarity between the word <emph>raven</emph> and the cry of
that bird. This seems still more so if we compare
the Anglo-Saxon <emph>hrafn</emph>, the German <emph>Rabe</emph>, Old High-German
<emph>hraban</emph>. The Sanskrit <emph>kârava</emph> also, the Latin
<emph>corvus</emph>, and the Greek <emph>korōnē</emph>, all are supposed to show
some similarity with the unmelodious sound of <emph>Maître
Corbeau</emph>. But as soon as we analyze the word we find
that it is of a different structure from <emph>cuckoo</emph> or <emph>cock</emph>.
It is derived from a root which has a general predicative
<pb n='363'/><anchor id='Pg363'/>
power. The root <emph>ru</emph> or <emph>kru</emph> is not a mere imitation
of the cry of the raven; it embraces many cries, from
the harshest to the softest, and it might have been
applied to the nightingale as well as to the raven. In
Sanskrit this root exists as <emph>ru</emph>, a verb which is applied
to the murmuring sound of rivers as well as to the
barking of dogs and the mooing of cows. From it are
derived numerous words in Sanskrit. In Latin we find
<emph>raucus</emph>, hoarse; <emph>rumor</emph>, a whisper; in German <emph>rûnen</emph>,
to speak low, and <emph>runa</emph>, mystery. The Latin <emph>lamentum</emph>
stands for an original <emph>ravimentum</emph> or <emph>cravimentum</emph>.
This root <emph>ru</emph> has several secondary forms, such as the Sanskrit
<emph>rud</emph>, to cry; the Latin <emph>rug</emph> in <emph>rugire</emph>, to howl;
the Greek <emph>kru</emph> or <emph>klu</emph>, in <emph>klaiō</emph>,
<emph>klausomai</emph>; the Sanskrit <emph>kruś</emph>, to shout; the Gothic
<emph>hrukjan</emph>, to crow, and <emph>hropjan</emph>,
to cry; the German <emph>rufen</emph>. Even the common
Aryan word for hearing is closely allied to this root.
It is <emph>śru</emph> in Sanskrit, <emph>klyō</emph> in Greek, <emph>cluo</emph> in
Latin; and before it took the recognized meaning of hearing, it
meant to sound, to ring. When a noise was to be
heard in a far distance, the man who first perceived
it might well have said I ring, for his ears were
sounding and ringing; and the same verb, if once
used as a transitive, expressed exactly what we mean
by I hear a noise.
</p>

<p>
You will have perceived thus that the process which
led to the formation of the word <emph>kârava</emph> in Sanskrit
is quite distinct from that which produced <emph>cuckoo</emph>.
<emph>Kârava</emph><note place='foot'><emph>Kârava</emph>, explained in
Sanskrit by <emph>ku-rava</emph>, having a bad voice, is supposed
to be a mere dialectical corruption of <emph>krava</emph> or <emph>karva</emph>.
Κορώνη presupposes
κορων = κοροον = <emph>h</emph>(<emph>a</emph>)<emph>raban</emph>.
The Sanskrit <emph>kârava</emph> may, however,
be derived from <emph>kâru</emph>, singer; but in that case <emph>kâru</emph> must not be
derived from <emph>kṛi</emph>.</note> means a shouter, a caller, a crier. It might
<pb n='364'/><anchor id='Pg364'/>
have been applied to many birds; but it became the
traditional and recognized name for the crow. Cuckoo
could never mean anything but the cuckoo, and while
a word like <emph>raven</emph> has ever so many relations from a
<emph>rumor</emph> down to <emph>a row</emph>, cuckoo stands by itself like a
stick in a living hedge.
</p>

<p>
It is curious to observe how apt we are to deceive
ourselves when we once adopt this system of Onomatopoieia.
Who does not imagine that he hears in the
word <q>thunder</q> an imitation of the rolling and rumbling
noise which the old Germans ascribed to their
God Thor playing at nine-pins? Yet <emph>thunder</emph> is
clearly the same word as the Latin <emph>tonitru</emph>. The root
is <emph>tan</emph>, to stretch. From this root <emph>tan</emph>, we have in
Greek <emph>tonos</emph>, our tone, <emph>tone</emph> being produced by the
stretching and vibrating of cords. In Sanskrit the
sound thunder is expressed by the same root <emph>tan</emph>, but
in the derivatives <emph>tanyu</emph>, <emph>tanyatu</emph>, and <emph>tanayitnu</emph>,
thundering, we perceive no trace of the rumbling noise
which we imagined we perceived in the Latin <emph>tonitru</emph>
and the English <emph>thunder</emph>. The very same root <emph>tan</emph>, to
stretch, yields some derivatives which are anything but
rough and noisy. The English <emph>tender</emph>, the French <emph>tendre</emph>,
the Latin <emph>tener</emph>, are derived from it. Like <emph>tenuis</emph>,
the Sanskrit <emph>tanu</emph>, the English <emph>thin</emph>, <emph>tener</emph> meant
originally what was extended over a larger surface, then <emph>thin</emph>, then
<emph>delicate</emph>. The relationship betwixt <emph>tender</emph>,
<emph>thin</emph>, and <emph>thunder</emph> would be hard to establish if the
original conception of thunder had really been its
rumbling noise.
</p>

<p>
Who does not imagine that he hears something sweet
in the French <emph>sucre</emph>, <emph>sucré</emph>? Yet sugar came from India,
and it is there called <emph>śarkhara</emph>, which is anything
<pb n='365'/><anchor id='Pg365'/>
but sweet sounding. This <emph>śarkhara</emph> is the same word
as <emph>sugar</emph>; it was called in Latin <emph>saccharum</emph>, and we
still speak of <emph>saccharine</emph> juice, which is sugar juice.
</p>

<p>
In <emph>squirrel</emph> again some people imagine they hear
something of the rustling and whirling of the little
animal. But we have only to trace the name back
to Greek, and there we find that <emph>skiouros</emph> is composed
of two distinct words, the one meaning shade, the
other tail; the animal being called shade-tail by the
Greeks.
</p>

<p>
Thus the word <emph>cat</emph>, the German <emph>katze</emph>, is supposed
to be an imitation of the sound made by a cat spitting.
But if the spitting were expressed by the sibilant, that
sibilant does not exist in the Latin <emph>catus</emph>, nor in <emph>cat</emph>, or
<emph>kitten</emph>, nor in the German <emph>kater</emph>.<note place='foot'>See
Pictet, Aryas Primitifs, p. 381.</note> The Sanskrit <emph>mârjâra</emph>,
cat, might seem to imitate the purring of the cat;
but it is derived from the root <emph>mṛij</emph>, to clean, <emph>mârjâra</emph>,
meaning the animal that always cleans itself.
</p>

<p>
Many more instances might be given to show how
easily we are deceived by the constant connection of
certain sounds and certain meanings in the words of
our own language, and how readily we imagine that
there is something in the sound to tell us the meaning
of the words. <q>The sound must seem an echo to the
sense.</q>
</p>

<p>
Most of these Onomatopoieias vanish as soon as we
trace our own names back to Anglo-Saxon and Gothic,
or compare them with their cognates in Greek, Latin,
or Sanskrit. The number of names which are really
formed by an imitation of sound dwindle down to a
very small quotum if cross-examined by the comparative
philologist, and we are left in the end with the
<pb n='366'/><anchor id='Pg366'/>
conviction that though <emph>a</emph> language might have been
made out of the roaring, fizzing, hissing, gobbling,
twittering, cracking, banging, slamming, and rattling
sounds of nature, the tongues with which <emph>we</emph> are acquainted
point to a different origin.<note place='foot'><p>In Chinese
the number of imitative sounds is very considerable. They
are mostly written phonetically, and followed by the determinative sign
<q>mouth.</q> We give a few, together with the corresponding sounds in
Mandshu. The difference between the two will show how differently the
same sounds strike different ears, and how differently they are rendered
into articulate language:&mdash;

Drums coupled together sound ḱan ḱan in Chinese, tung tung in Mandshu.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
And so we find many philosophers, and among them
Condillac, protesting against a theory which would
place man even below the animal. Why should man
be supposed, they say, to have taken a lesson from
birds and beasts? Does he not utter cries, and sobs,
and shouts himself, according as he is affected by fear,
pain, or joy? These cries or interjections were represented
as the natural and real beginnings of human
speech. Everything else was supposed to have been
elaborated after their model. This is what I call the
Interjectional, or Pooh-pooh, Theory.
</p>

<p>
Our answer to this theory is the same as to the
former. There are no doubt in every language interjections,
and some of them may become traditional,
and enter into the composition of words. But these
interjections are only the outskirts of real language.
Language begins where interjections end. There is
<pb n='367'/><anchor id='Pg367'/>
as much difference between a real word, such as <q>to
laugh,</q> and the interjection ha, ha! between <q>I suffer,</q>
and oh! as there is between the involuntary act
and noise of sneezing, and the verb <q>to sneeze.</q> We
sneeze, and cough, and scream, and laugh in the same
manner as animals, but if Epicurus tells us that we
speak in the same manner as dogs bark, moved by
nature,<note place='foot'>Ὁ γὰρ Ἐπίκουρος ἔλεγεν, ὅτι
οὑχὶ ἐπιστημόνως οὖτοι ἔθεντο τὰ ὀνόματα,
ἀλλὰ φυσικῶς κινούμενοι, ὡς οἱ βήσσοντες καὶ πταίροντες καὶ μυκώμενοι
καὶ ὐλακτοῦντες καὶ στενάζοντες.&mdash;Lersch, Sprach-philosophie der Alten, i.
40. The statement is taken from Proclus, and I doubt whether he represented
Epicurus rightly.</note> our own experience will tell us that this is
not the case.
</p>

<p>
An excellent answer to the interjectional theory has
been given by Horne Tooke.
</p>

<p>
<q>The dominion of speech,</q> he says,<note place='foot'>Diversions
of Purley, p. 32.</note> <q>is erected
upon the downfall of interjections. Without the artful
contrivances of language, mankind would have
had nothing but interjections with which to communicate,
orally, any of their feelings. The neighing of a
horse, the lowing of a cow, the barking of a dog, the
purring of a cat, sneezing, coughing, groaning, shrieking,
and every other involuntary convulsion with oral
sound, have almost as good a title to be called parts
of speech, as interjections have. Voluntary interjections
are only employed where the suddenness and
vehemence of some affection or passion returns men
to their natural state; and makes them for a moment
forget the use of speech; or when, from some circumstance,
the shortness of time will not permit them to
exercise it.</q>
</p>

<p>
As in the case of Onomatopoieia, it cannot be denied
<pb n='368'/><anchor id='Pg368'/>
that with interjections, too, some kind of language
might have been formed; but not a language like that
which we find in numerous varieties among all the races
of men. One short interjection may be more powerful,
more to the point, more eloquent than a long speech.
In fact, interjections, together with gestures, the movements
of the muscles of the mouth, and the eye, would
be quite sufficient for all purposes which language answers
with the majority of mankind. Lucian, in his
treatise on dancing, mentions a king whose dominions
bordered on the Euxine. He happened to be at Rome
in the reign of Nero, and, having seen a pantomime
perform, begged him of the emperor as a present, in
order that he might employ him as an interpreter
among the nations in his neighborhood with whom he
could hold no intercourse on account of the diversity
of language. A pantomime meant a person who could
mimic everything, and there is hardly anything which
cannot be thus expressed. We, having language at
our command, have neglected the art of speaking without
words; but in the south of Europe that art is
still preserved. If it be true that one look may speak
volumes, it is clear that we might save ourselves
much of the trouble entailed by the use of discursive
speech. Yet we must not forget that <emph>hum!</emph> <emph>ugh!</emph>
<emph>tut!</emph> <emph>pooh!</emph> are as little to be called words as the expressive
gestures which usually accompany these exclamations.
</p>

<p>
As to the attempts at deriving some of our words
etymologically from mere interjections, they are apt to
fail from the same kind of misconception which leads
us to imagine that there is something expressive in the
sounds of words. Thus it is said <q>that the idea of
<pb n='369'/><anchor id='Pg369'/>
disgust takes its rise in the senses of smell and taste, in
the first instance probably in smell alone; that in defending
ourselves from a bad smell we are instinctively
impelled to screw up the nose, and to expire strongly
through the compressed and protruded lips, giving rise
to a sound represented by the interjections faugh! foh!
fie! From this interjection it is proposed to derive, not
only such words as <emph>foul</emph> and <emph>filth</emph>, but, by transferring it
from natural to moral aversion, the English <emph>fiend</emph>, the
German <emph>Feind</emph>.</q> If this were true, we should suppose
that the expression of contempt was chiefly conveyed
by the aspirate f, by the strong emission of the breathing
with half-opened lips. But <emph>fiend</emph> is a participle from
a root <emph>fian</emph>, to hate; in Gothic <emph>fijan</emph>; and as a Gothic
aspirate always corresponds to a tenuis in Sanskrit, the
same root in Sanskrit would at once lose its expressive
power. It exists in fact in Sanskrit as <emph>pîy</emph>, to hate, to
destroy; just as <emph>friend</emph> is derived from a root which in
Sanskrit is <emph>prî</emph>, to delight.<note place='foot'><p>The
following list of Chinese interjections may be of interest:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
hu, to express surprise.<lb/>
fu, the same.<lb/>
tsai, to express admiration and approbation.<lb/>
i, to express distress.<lb/>
tsie, vocative particle.<lb/>
tsie tsie, exhortative particle.<lb/>
ài, to express contempt.<lb/>
ŭ-hu, to express pain.<lb/>
shin-ĭ, ah, indeed.<lb/>
pŭ sin, alas!<lb/>
ngo, stop!
</p>
<p>
In many cases interjections were originally words, just as the French <emph>hélas</emph>
is derived from <emph>lassus</emph>, tired, miserable. Diez, Lexicon Etymologicum, s.
v. <emph>lasso</emph>.</p></note>
</p>

<p>
There is one more remark which I have to make
about the Interjectional and the Onomatopoëtic theories,
<pb n='370'/><anchor id='Pg370'/>
namely this: If the constituent elements of human
speech were either mere cries, or the mimicking of the
cries of nature, it would be difficult to understand why
brutes should be without language. There is not only
the parrot, but the mocking-bird and others, which can
imitate most successfully both articulate and inarticulate
sounds; and there is hardly an animal without the faculty
of uttering interjections, such as huff, hiss, baa, &amp;c.
It is clear also that if what puts a perfect distinction
betwixt man and brutes is the having of general ideas,
language which arises from interjections and from the
imitation of the cries of animals could not claim to be
the outward sign of that distinctive faculty of man.
All words, in the beginning at least (and this is the
only point which interests us), would have been the
signs of individual impressions and individual perceptions,
and would only gradually have been adapted to
the expression of general ideas.
</p>

<p>
The theory which is suggested to us by an analysis
of language carried out according to the principles of
comparative philology is the very opposite. We arrive
in the end at roots, and every one of these expresses a
general, not an individual, idea. Every name, if we
analyze it, contains a predicate by which the object to
which the name applies was known.
</p>

<p>
There is an old controversy among philosophers,
whether language originated in general appellations, or
in proper names.<note place='foot'>Sir W. Hamilton's Lectures,
ii. p. 319.</note> It is the question of the <emph>primum
cognitum</emph>, and its consideration will help us perhaps in
discovering the true nature of the root, or the <emph>primum
appellatum</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Some philosophers, among whom I may mention
<pb n='371'/><anchor id='Pg371'/>
Locke, Condillac, Adam Smith, Dr. Brown, and with
some qualification Dugald Stewart, maintain that all
terms, as at first employed, are expressive of individual
objects. I quote from Adam Smith. <q>The assignation,</q>
he says, <q>of particular names to denote particular
objects, that is, the institution of nouns substantive,
would probably be one of the first steps towards the
formation of language. Two savages who had never
been taught to speak, but had been bred up remote
from the societies of men, would naturally begin to
form that language by which they would endeavor to
make their mutual wants intelligible to each other by
uttering certain sounds whenever they meant to denote
certain objects. Those objects only which were most
familiar to them, and which they had most frequent
occasion to mention, would have particular names assigned
to them. The particular cave whose covering
sheltered them from the weather, the particular tree
whose fruit relieved their hunger, the particular fountain
whose water allayed their thirst, would first be denominated
by the words <emph>cave</emph>, <emph>tree</emph>, <emph>fountain</emph>, or by
whatever other appellations they might think proper,
in that primitive jargon, to mark them. Afterwards,
when the more enlarged experience of these savages
had led them to observe, and their necessary occasions
obliged them to make mention of, other caves, and other
trees, and other fountains, they would naturally bestow
upon each of those new objects the same name by which
they had been accustomed to express the similar object
they were first acquainted with. The new objects had
none of them any name of its own, but each of them
exactly resembled another object which had such an
appellation. It was impossible that those savages could
<pb n='372'/><anchor id='Pg372'/>
behold the new objects without recollecting the old
ones; and the name of the old ones, to which the new
bore so close a resemblance. When they had occasion,
therefore, to mention or to point out to each other any
of the new objects, they would naturally utter the name
of the correspondent old one, of which the idea could
not fail, at that instant, to present itself to their memory
in the strongest and liveliest manner. And thus
those words, which were originally the proper names
of individuals, became the common name of a multitude.
A child that is just learning to speak calls every
person who comes to the house its papa or its mamma;
and thus bestows upon the whole species those names
which it had been taught to apply to two individuals.
I have known a clown who did not know the proper
name of the river which ran by his own door. It was
<emph>the river</emph>, he said, and he never heard any other name
for it. His experience, it seems, had not led him to
observe any other river. The general word <emph>river</emph> therefore
was, it is evident, in his acceptance of it, a proper
name signifying an individual object. If this person
had been carried to another river, would he not readily
have called it <emph>a river</emph>? Could we suppose any person
living on the banks of the Thames so ignorant as not
to know the general word <emph>river</emph>, but to be acquainted
only with the particular word <emph>Thames</emph>, if he were
brought to any other river, would he not readily call
it a <emph>Thames</emph>? This, in reality, is no more than what
they who are well acquainted with the general word
are very apt to do. An Englishman, describing any
great river which he may have seen in some foreign
country, naturally says that it is another Thames....
It is this application of the name of an individual
<pb n='373'/><anchor id='Pg373'/>
to a great multitude of objects, whose resemblance
naturally recalls the idea of that individual, and
of the name which expresses it, that seems originally
to have given occasion to the formation of those classes
and assortments which, in the schools, are called <emph>genera</emph>
and <emph>species</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
This extract from Adam Smith will give a clear idea
of one view of the formation of thought and language.
I shall now read another extract, representing the diametrically
opposite view. It is taken from Leibniz,<note place='foot'>Nouveaux
Essais, lib. iii. c. i. p. 297 (Erdmann); Sir W. Hamilton,
Lectures, ii. 324.</note>
who maintains that general terms are necessary for the
essential constitution of languages. He likewise appeals
to children. <q>Children,</q> he says, <q>and those
who know but little of the language which they attempt
to speak, or little of the subject on which they would
employ it, make use of general terms, as <emph>thing</emph>, <emph>plant</emph>,
<emph>animal</emph>, instead of using proper names, of which they
are destitute. And it is certain that all proper or individual
names have been originally appellative or general.</q>
And again: <q>Thus I would make bold to
affirm that almost all words have been originally general
terms, because it would happen very rarely that
man would invent a name, expressly and without a
reason, to denote this or that individual. We may,
therefore, assert that the names of individual things
were names of species, which were given <emph>par excellence</emph>,
or otherwise, to some individual; as the name <emph>Great
Head</emph> to him of the whole town who had the largest,
or who was the man of the most consideration of the
great heads known.</q>
</p>

<p>
It might seem presumptuous to attempt to arbitrate
<pb n='374'/><anchor id='Pg374'/>
between such men as Leibniz and Adam Smith, particularly
when both speak so positively as they do on
this subject. But there are two ways of judging of
former philosophers. One is to put aside their opinions
as simply erroneous where they differ from our own.
This is the least satisfactory way of studying ancient
philosophy. Another way is to try to enter fully into
the opinions of those from whom we differ, to make
them, for a time at least, our own, till at last we discover
the point of view from which each philosopher
looked at the facts before him, and catch the light in
which he regarded them. We shall then find that
there is much less of downright error in the history
of philosophy than is commonly supposed; nay, we
shall find nothing so conducive to a right appreciation
of truth as a right appreciation of the error by which
it is surrounded.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the case before us, Adam Smith is no doubt
right, when he says that the first individual cave which
is called cave gave the name to all other caves. In the
same manner, the first <emph>town</emph>, though a mere enclosure,
gave the name to all other towns; the first imperial residence
on the Palatine hill gave the name to all palaces.
Slight differences between caves, towns, or palaces are
readily passed by, and the first name becomes more
and more general with every new individual to which
it is applied. So far Adam Smith is right, and the
history of almost every substantive might be cited in
support of his view. But Leibniz is equally right
when, in looking beyond the first emergence of such
names as cave or town or palace, he asks how such
names could have arisen. Let us take the Latin names
of cave. A cave in Latin is called <emph>antrum</emph>,
<emph>cavea</emph>, <emph>spelunca</emph>.
<pb n='375'/><anchor id='Pg375'/>
Now <emph>antrum</emph> means really the same as <emph>internum</emph>.
<emph>Antar</emph> in Sanskrit means <emph>between</emph> and
<emph>within</emph>.<note place='foot'>Pott, Etymologische Forschungen, p. 324,
<hi rend='italic'>seq.</hi></note> <emph>Antrum</emph>,
therefore, meant originally what is within or inside the
earth or anything else. It is clear, therefore, that such
a name could not have been given to any individual
cave, unless the general idea of being within, or inwardness,
had been present in the mind. This general
idea once formed, and once expressed by the pronominal
root <emph>an</emph> or <emph>antar</emph>, the process of naming is clear and
intelligible. The place where the savage could live
safe from rain and from the sudden attacks of wild
beasts, a natural hollow in the rock, he would call his
<emph>within</emph>, his <emph>antrum</emph>; and afterwards similar places,
whether dug in the earth or cut in a tree, would be
designated by the same name. The same general
idea, however, would likewise supply other names,
and thus we find that the <emph>entrails</emph> were called <emph>antra</emph>
(neuter) in Sanskrit, <emph>enteron</emph> in Greek, originally
things within.
</p>

<p>
Let us take another word for cave, which is <emph>căvea</emph> or
<emph>căverna</emph>. Here again Adam Smith would be perfectly
right in maintaining that this name, when first given,
was applied to one particular cave, and was afterwards
extended to other caves. But Leibniz would be equally
right in maintaining that in order to call even the first
hollow <emph>cavea</emph>, it was necessary that the general idea of
<emph>hollow</emph> should have been formed in the mind, and should
have received its vocal expression <emph>cav</emph>. Nay we may
go a step beyond, for <emph>cavus</emph>, or hollow, is a secondary,
not a primary, idea. Before a cave was called <emph>cavea</emph>, a
hollow thing, many things hollow had passed before the
eyes of men. Why then was a hollow thing, or a hole,
<pb n='376'/><anchor id='Pg376'/>
called by the root <emph>cav</emph>? Because what had been hollowed
out was intended at first as a place of safety and
protection, as a cover; and it was called therefore by
the root <emph>ku</emph> or <emph>sku</emph>, which conveyed the idea of
to cover.<note place='foot'>Benfey, Griech. Wurzel Lex. p. 611. From <emph>sku</emph> or
<emph>ku</emph>, σκῦτος, skin;
<emph>cŭtis</emph>, <emph>haut</emph>.</note>
Hence the general idea of covering existed in the mind
before it was applied to hiding-places in rocks or trees,
and it was not till an expression had thus been framed
for things hollow or safe in general, that caves in particular
could be designated by the name of <emph>cavea</emph> or
hollows.
</p>

<p>
Another form for <emph>cavus</emph> was <emph>koilos</emph>, hollow. The
conception was originally the same; a hole was called
<emph>koilon</emph> because it served as a cover. But once so used
<emph>koilon</emph> came to mean a cave, a vaulted cave, a vault,
and thus the heaven was called <emph>cœlum</emph>, the modern <emph>ciel</emph>,
because it was looked upon as a vault or cover for the
earth.
</p>

<p>
It is the same with all nouns. They all express
originally one out of the many attributes of a thing,
and that attribute, whether it be a quality or an action,
is necessarily a general idea. The word thus formed
was in the first instance intended for one object only,
though of course it was almost immediately extended
to the whole class to which this object seemed to
belong. When a word such as <emph>rivus</emph>, river, was first
formed, no doubt it was intended for a certain river, and that
river was called <emph>rivus</emph>, from a root <emph>ru</emph> or <emph>sru</emph>,
to run, because of its running water. In many instances
a word meaning river or runner remained the
proper name of one river, without ever rising to the
dignity of an appellative. Thus <emph>Rhenus</emph>, the Rhine,
<pb n='377'/><anchor id='Pg377'/>
means river or runner, but it clung to one river, and
could not be used as an appellative for others. The
Ganges is the Sanskrit <emph>Gangâ</emph>, literally the Go-go; a
word very well adapted for any majestic river, but
in Sanskrit restricted to the one sacred stream. The
Indus again is the Sanskrit <emph>Sindhu</emph>, and means the irrigator,
from <emph>syand</emph>, to sprinkle. In this case, however,
the proper name was not checked in its growth, but
was used likewise as an appelative for any great stream.
</p>

<p>
We have thus seen how the controversy about the
<emph>primum cognitum</emph> assumes a new and perfectly clear
aspect. The first thing really known is the general.
It is through it that we know and name afterwards
individual objects of which any general idea can be
predicated, and it is only in the third stage that these
individual objects, thus known and named, become
again the representatives of whole classes, and their
names or proper names are raised into appellatives.<note place='foot'>Sir
William Hamilton (Lectures on Metaphysics, ii. p. 327) holds a
view intermediate between those of Adam Smith and Leibniz. <q>As our
knowledge,</q> he says, <q>proceeds from the confused to the distinct, from
the vague to the determinate, so, in the mouths of children, language at
first expresses neither the precisely general nor the determinately individual,
but the vague and confused, and out of this the universal is elaborated
by generification, the particular and singular by specification and
individualisation.</q> Some further remarks on this point in the Literary
Gazette, 1861, p. 173.</note>
</p>

<p>
There is a petrified philosophy in language, and if
we examine the most ancient word for name we find it is
<emph>nâman</emph> in Sanskrit, <emph>nomen</emph> in Latin, <emph>namo</emph> in Gothic.
This <emph>nâman</emph> stands for <emph>gnâman</emph>, which is preserved in
the Latin <emph>co-gnomen</emph>. The <emph>g</emph> is dropped as in <emph>natus</emph>,
son, for <emph>gnatus</emph>. <emph>Nâman</emph>, therefore, and name are
derived from the root gnâ, to know, and meant originally
that by which we know a thing.
</p>

<pb n='378'/><anchor id='Pg378'/>

<p>
And how do we know things? We perceive things
by our senses, but our senses convey to us information
about single things only. But to <emph>know</emph> is more than to
feel, than to perceive, more than to remember, more
than to compare. No doubt words are much abused.
We speak of a dog <emph>knowing</emph> his master, of an infant
<emph>knowing</emph> his mother. In such expressions, to know
means to recognize. But to know a thing, means
more than to recognize it. We know a thing if we
are able to bring it, and any part of it, under more
general ideas. We then say, not that we have a perception,
but a conception, or that we have a general
idea of a thing. The facts of nature are perceived by
our senses; the thoughts of nature, to borrow an expression
of Oersted's, can be conceived by our reason
only.<note place='foot'><q>We receive the impression of the falling of a large mass of
water, descending always from the same height and with the same difficulty.
The scattering of the drops of water, the formation of froth, the sound of
the fall by the roaring and by the froth, are constantly produced by the
same causes, and, consequently, are always the same. The impression
which all this produces on us is no doubt at first felt as multiform, but it
soon forms a whole, or, in other terms, we feel all the diversity of the isolated
impressions as the work of a great physical activity which results
from the particular nature of the spot. We may, perhaps, till we are better
informed, call all that is fixed in the phenomenon, <emph>the thoughts of
nature</emph>.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Oersted,
Esprit dans la Nature</hi>, p. 152.</note> Now the first step towards this real knowledge,
a step which, however small in appearance, separates
man forever from all other animals, is the <emph>naming of a
thing</emph>, or the making a thing knowable. All naming
is classification, bringing the individual under the general;
and whatever we know, whether empirically or
scientifically, we know it only by means of our general
ideas. Other animals have sensation, perception,
memory, and, in a certain sense, intellect; but all
<pb n='379'/><anchor id='Pg379'/>
these, in the animal, are conversant with single objects
only. Man has sensation, perception, memory, intellect,
and reason, and it is his reason only that is conversant
with general ideas.<note place='foot'><q>Ce qui trompe l'homme,
c'est qu'il voit faire aux bêtes plusieurs des
choses qu'il fait, et qu'il ne voit pas que, dans ces choses-là même, les bêtes
ne mettent qu'une intelligence grossière, bornée, et qu'il met, lui, une
intelligence <emph>doublée d'esprit</emph>.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Flourens,

</p>

<p>
Through reason we not only stand a step above the
brute creation: we belong to a different world. We
look down on our merely animal experience, on our
sensations, perceptions, our memory, and our intellect,
as something belonging to us, but not as constituting
our most inward and eternal self. Our senses, our
memory, our intellect, are like the lenses of a telescope.
But there is an eye that looks through them at the
realities of the outer world, our own rational and self-conscious
soul; a power as distinct from our perceptive
faculties as the sun is from the earth which it fills
with light, and warmth, and life.
</p>

<p>
At the very point where man parts company with
the brute world, at the first flash of reason as the
manifestation of the light within us, there we see the
true genesis of language. Analyze any word you like,
and you will find that it expresses a general idea peculiar
to the individual to which the name belongs. What
is the meaning of moon?&mdash;the measurer. What is the
meaning of sun?&mdash;the begetter. What is the meaning
of earth?&mdash;the ploughed. The old name given to
animals, such as cows and sheep, was <emph>pasú</emph>, the Latin
<emph>pecus</emph>, which means <emph>feeders</emph>. <emph>Animal</emph> itself is a
later name, and derived from <emph>anima</emph>, soul. This <emph>anima</emph> again
meant originally blowing or breathing, like spirit from
<pb n='380'/><anchor id='Pg380'/>
<emph>spirare</emph>, and was derived from a root, <emph>an</emph>, to blow,
which gives us <emph>anila</emph>, wind, in Sanskrit, and <emph>anemos</emph>,
wind, in Greek. <emph>Ghost</emph>, the German <emph>Geist</emph>, is based on
the same conception. It is connected with <emph>gust</emph>, with
<emph>yeast</emph>, and even with the hissing and boiling <emph>geysers</emph> of
Iceland. <emph>Soul</emph> is the Gothic <emph>saivala</emph>, and this is clearly
related to another Gothic word, <emph>saivs</emph>,<note place='foot'>See Heyse,
System der Sprachwissenschaft, s. 97.</note> which means
the sea. The sea was called <emph>saivs</emph> from a root <emph>si</emph> or
<emph>siv</emph>, the Greek <emph>seiō</emph>, to shake; it meant the tossed-about
water, in contradistinction to stagnant or running
water. The soul being called <emph>saivala</emph>, we see
that it was originally conceived by the Teutonic nations
as a sea within, heaving up and down with every
breath, and reflecting heaven and earth on the mirror
of the deep.
</p>

<p>
The Sanskrit name for love is <emph>smara</emph>; it is derived
from <emph>smar</emph>, to recollect; and the same root has supplied
the German <emph>schmerz</emph>, pain, and the English <emph>smart</emph>.
</p>

<p>
If the serpent is called in Sanskrit <emph>sarpa</emph>, it is
because it was conceived under the general idea of
creeping, an idea expressed by the word <emph>srip</emph>. But the
serpent was also called <emph>ahi</emph> in Sanskrit, in Greek <emph>echis</emph>
or <emph>echidna</emph>, in Latin <emph>anguis</emph>. This name is derived
from quite a different root and idea. The root is <emph>ah</emph>
in Sanskrit, or <emph>anh</emph>, which means to press together, to
choke, to throttle. Here the distinguishing mark
from which the serpent was named was his throttling,
and <emph>ahi</emph> meant serpent, as expressing the general idea
of throttler. It is a curious root this <emph>anh</emph>, and it still
lives in several modern words. In Latin it appears as
<emph>ango</emph>, <emph>anxi</emph>, <emph>anctum</emph>, to strangle, in
<emph>angina</emph>, quinsy,<note place='foot'>The word <emph>quinsy</emph>,
as was pointed out to me, offers a striking illustration
of the ravages produced by phonetic decay. The root <emph>anh</emph> has here completely
vanished. But it was there originally, for <emph>quinsy</emph> is the Greek
κυνάγχη, dog-throttling. See Richardson's Dictionary, s. v. quinancy.</note> in
<pb n='381'/><anchor id='Pg381'/>
<emph>angor</emph>, suffocation. But <emph>angor</emph> meant not only quinsy
or compression of the neck; it assumed a moral import
and signifies anguish or anxiety. The two adjectives
<emph>angustus</emph>, narrow, and <emph>anxius</emph>, uneasy, both come from
the same source. In Greek the root retained its natural
and material meaning; in <emph>eggys</emph>, near, and <emph>echis</emph>,
serpent, throttler. But in Sanskrit it was chosen with
great truth as the proper name of sin. Evil no doubt
presented itself under various aspects to the human
mind, and its names are many; but none so expressive
as those derived from our root, <emph>anh</emph>, to throttle. <emph>Anhas</emph>
in Sanskrit means sin, but it does so only because it
meant originally throttling,&mdash;the consciousness of sin
being like the grasp of the assassin on the throat of his
victim. All who have seen and contemplated the
statue of Laokoon and his sons, with the serpent
coiled round them from head to foot, may realize
what those ancients felt and saw when they called sin
<emph>anhas</emph>, or the throttler. This <emph>anhas</emph> is the same word
as the Greek <emph>agos</emph>, sin. In Gothic the same root has
produced <emph>agis</emph>, in the sense of <emph>fear</emph>, and from the same
source we have <emph>awe</emph>, in awful, <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> fearful, and
<emph>ug</emph>, in <emph>ugly</emph>. The English <emph>anguish</emph> is
from the French <emph>angoisse</emph>,
the Italian <emph>angoscia</emph>, a corruption of the Latin
<emph>angustiæ</emph>, a strait.
</p>

<p>
And how did those early thinkers and framers of
language distinguish between man and the other animals?
What general idea did they connect with the
first conception of themselves? The Latin word <emph>homo</emph>,
the French <emph>l'homme</emph>, which has been reduced to <emph>on</emph> in
<pb n='382'/><anchor id='Pg382'/>
<emph>on dit</emph>, is derived from the same root which we have in
<emph>humus</emph>, the soil, <emph>humilis</emph>, humble. <emph>Homo</emph>, therefore,
would express the idea of a being made of the dust
of the earth.<note place='foot'>Greek χαμαί, Zend <emph>zem</emph>, Lithuanian
<emph>zeme</emph>, and <emph>źmenes</emph>, <emph>homines</emph>. See
Bopp, Glossarium Sanscritum, s. v.</note>
</p>

<p>
Another ancient word for man was the Sanskrit
<emph>marta</emph>,<note place='foot'>See Windischmann, Fortschritt der
Sprachenkunde, p. 23.</note> the Greek <emph>brotos</emph>,
the Latin <emph>mortalis</emph> (a secondary
derivative), our own <emph>mortal</emph>. <emph>Marta</emph> means <q>he
who dies,</q> and it is remarkable that where everything
else was changing, fading, and dying, this should have
been chosen as the distinguishing name for man.
Those early poets would hardly have called themselves
mortals unless they had believed in other beings as
immortal.
</p>

<p>
There is a third name for man which means simply
the thinker, and this, the true title of our race, still
lives in the name of <emph>man</emph>. <emph>Mâ</emph> in Sanskrit means to
measure, from which you remember we had the name
of moon. <emph>Man</emph>, a derivative root, means to think.
From this we have the Sanskrit <emph>manu</emph>, originally
thinker, then man. In the later Sanskrit we find
derivatives, such as <emph>mânava</emph>, <emph>mânusha</emph>, <emph>manushya</emph>, all
expressing man. In Gothic we find both <emph>man</emph>, and
<emph>mannisks</emph>, the modern German <emph>mann</emph> and <emph>mensch</emph>.
</p>

<p>
There were many more names for man, as there were
many names for all things in ancient languages. Any
feature that struck the observing mind as peculiarly
characteristic could be made to furnish a new name.
The sun might be called the bright, the warm, the golden,
the preserver, the destroyer, the wolf, the lion, the
heavenly eye, the father of light and life. Hence that
<pb n='383'/><anchor id='Pg383'/>
superabundance of synonymes in ancient dialects, and
hence that <emph>struggle for life</emph> carried on among these words,
which led to the destruction of the less strong, the less
happy, the less fertile words, and ended in the triumph
of <emph>one</emph>, as the recognized and proper name for every
object in every language. On a very small scale this
process of <emph>natural selection</emph>, or, as it would better be
called, <emph>elimination</emph>, may still be watched even in modern
languages, that is to say, even in languages so old and
full of years as English and French. What it was at the
first burst of dialects we can only gather from such isolated
cases as when Vón Hammer counts 5744 words
relating to the camel.<note place='foot'>Farrar, Origin of Language, p. 85.</note>
</p>

<p>
The fact that every word is originally a predicate,
that names, though signs of individual conceptions, are
all, without exception, derived from general ideas, is one
of the most important discoveries in the science of language.
It was known before that language is the distinguishing
characteristic of man; it was known also
that the having of general ideas is that which puts a
perfect distinction betwixt man and brutes; but that
these two were only different expressions of the same
fact was not known till the theory of roots had been
established as preferable to the theories both of Onomatopoieia
and of Interjections. But, though our
modern philosophy did not know it, the ancient poets
and framers of language must have known it. For in
Greek language is <emph>logos</emph>, but <emph>logos</emph> means also reason,
and <emph>alogon</emph> was chosen as the name, and the most
proper name, for brute. No animal thinks, and no
animal speaks, except man. Language and thought
are inseparable. Words without thought are dead
<pb n='384'/><anchor id='Pg384'/>
sounds; thoughts without words are nothing. To
think is to speak low; to speak is to think aloud.
The word is the thought incarnate.
</p>

<p>
And now I am afraid I have but a few minutes left to
explain the last question of all in our science, namely&mdash;How
can sound express thought? How did roots
become the signs of general ideas? How was the abstract
idea of measuring expressed by <emph>mâ</emph>, the idea of
thinking by <emph>man</emph>? How did <emph>gâ</emph> come to mean going,
<emph>sthâ</emph> standing, <emph>sad</emph> sitting, <emph>dâ</emph> giving,
<emph>mar</emph> dying, <emph>char</emph>
walking, <emph>kar</emph> doing?
</p>

<p>
I shall try to answer as briefly as possible. The 400
or 500 roots which remain as the constituent elements
in different families of language are not interjections,
nor are they imitations. They are <emph>phonetic types</emph> produced
by a power inherent in human nature. They
exist, as Plato would say, by nature; though with
Plato we should add that, when we say by nature, we
mean by the hand of God.<note place='foot'>Θήσω τὰ
μὲν φύσει λεγόμενα ποιεῖσθαι θείᾳ τέχνη.</note> There is a law which
runs through nearly the whole of nature, that everything
which is struck rings. Each substance has its
peculiar ring. We can tell the more or less perfect
structure of metals by their vibrations, by the answer
which they give. Gold rings differently from tin, wood
rings differently from stone; and different sounds are
produced according to the nature of each percussion.
It was the same with man, the most highly organized
of nature's works.<note place='foot'>This view
was propounded many years ago by Professor Heyse in the
lectures which he gave at Berlin, and which have been very carefully published
since his death by one of his pupils, Dr. Steinthal. The fact that
wood, metals, cords, &amp;c., if struck, vibrate and ring, can, of course, be used
as an illustration only, and not as an explanation. The faculty peculiar to
man, in his primitive state, by which every impression from without received
its vocal expression from within, must be accepted as an ultimate
fact. That faculty must have existed in man, because its effects continue
to exist. Analogies from the inanimate world, however, are useful, and
deserve farther examination.</note> Man, in his primitive and perfect
<pb n='385'/><anchor id='Pg385'/>
state, was not only endowed, like the brute, with the
power of expressing his sensations by interjections, and
his perceptions by onomatopoieia. He possessed likewise
the faculty of giving more articulate expression to
the rational conceptions of his mind. That faculty
was not of his own making. It was an instinct, an
instinct of the mind as irresistible as any other instinct.
So far as language is the production of that instinct, it
belongs to the realm of nature. Man loses his instincts
as he ceases to want them. His senses become fainter
when, as in the case of scent, they become useless.
Thus the creative faculty which gave to each conception,
as it thrilled for the first time through the brain,
a phonetic expression, became extinct when its object
was fulfilled. The number of these <emph>phonetic types</emph> must
have been almost infinite in the beginning, and it was
only through the same process of <emph>natural elimination</emph>
which we observed in the early history of words, that
clusters of roots, more or less synonymous, were gradually
reduced to one definite type. Instead of deriving
language from nine roots, like Dr. Murray,<note place='foot'>Dr. Murray's
primitive roots were, ag, bag, dwag, cwag, lag, mag, nag,
rag, swag.</note> or from
<emph>one</emph> root, a feat actually accomplished by a Dr.
Schmidt,<note place='foot'>Curtius, Griechische Etymologie, p. 13. Dr. Schmidt derives all
Greek words from the root <emph>e</emph>, and all Latin
words from the arch-radical <emph>hi</emph>.</note>
we must suppose that the first settlement of the radical
elements of language was preceded by a period of unrestrained
growth,&mdash;the spring of speech&mdash;to be followed
by many an autumn.
</p>

<pb n='386'/><anchor id='Pg386'/>

<p>
With the process of elimination, or natural selection,
the historical element enters into the science of
language. However primitive the Chinese may be
as compared with terminational and inflectional languages,
its roots or words have clearly passed through
a long process of mutual attrition. There are many
things of a merely traditional character even in Chinese.
The rule that in a simple sentence the first word is the
subject, the second the verb, the third the object, is a
traditional rule. It is by tradition only that <emph>ngŏ ģin</emph>,
in Chinese, means a bad man, whereas <emph>ģin ngŏ</emph> signifies
man is bad. The Chinese themselves distinguish between
<emph>full</emph> and <emph>empty</emph> roots,<note place='foot'>Endlicher,
Chinesische Grammatik, p. 163.</note> the former being predicative,
the latter corresponding to our particles which
modify the meaning of full roots and determine their
relation to each other. It is only by tradition that
roots become empty. All roots were originally full
whether predicative or demonstrative, and the fact that
empty roots in Chinese cannot always be traced back
to their full prototypes shows that even the most ancient
Chinese had passed through successive periods of
growth. Chinese commentators admit that all empty
words were originally full words, just as Sanskrit grammarians
maintain that all that is found in grammar was
originally substantial. But we must be satisfied with
but partial proofs of this general principle, and must be
prepared to find as many fanciful derivations in Chinese
as in Sanskrit. The fact, again, that all roots in Chinese
are no longer capable of being employed at pleasure,
either as substantives, or verbs, or adjectives, is
another proof that, even in this most primitive stage,
language points back to a previous growth. <emph>Fu</emph> is father,
<pb n='387'/><anchor id='Pg387'/>
<emph>mu</emph> is mother; <emph>fu mu</emph> parents; but neither <emph>fu</emph> nor
<emph>mu</emph> is used as a root in its original predicative sense.
The amplest proof, however, of the various stages
through which even so simple a language as Chinese
must have passed is to be found in the comparatively
small number of roots, and in the definite meanings
attached to each; a result which could only have been
obtained by that constant struggle which has been so
well described in natural history as the struggle for life.
</p>

<p>
But although this sifting of roots, and still more the
subsequent combination of roots, cannot be ascribed to
the mere working of nature or natural instincts, it is
still less, as we saw in a former Lecture, the effect of
deliberate or premeditated art, in the sense in which,
for instance, a picture of Raphael or a symphony of
Beethoven is. Given a root to express flying, or bird,
and another to express heap, then the joining together
of the two to express many birds, or birds in the plural,
is the natural effect of the synthetic power of the human
mind, or, to use more homely language, of the
power of putting two and two together. Some philosophers
maintain indeed that this explains nothing,
and that the real mystery to be solved is how the mind
can form a synthesis, or conceive many things as one.
Into those depths we cannot follow. Other philosophers
imagine that the combination of roots to form
agglutinative and inflectional language is, like the first
formation of roots, the result of a natural instinct.
Thus Professor Heyse<note place='foot'>System der
Sprachwissenschaft, p. 16.</note> maintained that <q>the various
forms of development in language must be explained
by the philosophers as <emph>necessary</emph> evolutions, founded in
the very essence of human speech.</q> This is not the
<pb n='388'/><anchor id='Pg388'/>
case. We can watch the growth of language, and we
can understand and explain all that is the result of that
growth. But we cannot undertake to prove that all
that is in language is so by necessity, and could not
have been otherwise. When we have, as in Chinese,
two such words as <emph>kiai</emph> and <emph>tu</emph>, both expressing a heap,
an assembly, a quantity, then we may perfectly understand
why either the one or the other should have been
used to form the plural. But if one of the two becomes
fixed and traditional, while the other becomes obsolete,
then we can register the fact as historical, but no
philosophy on earth will explain its absolute necessity.
We can perfectly understand how, with two such roots
as <emph>kûŏ</emph>, empire, and <emph>ćung</emph>, middle, the Chinese should
have formed what we call a locative, <emph>kŭŏ ćung</emph>, in the
empire. But to say that this was the only way to express
this conception is an assertion contradicted both
by fact and reason. We saw the various ways in which
the future can be formed. They are all equally intelligible
and equally possible, but not one of them is
inevitable. In Chinese <emph>ỳaó</emph> means to will, <emph>ngò</emph> is I;
hence <emph>ngò ỳaó</emph>, I will. The same root <emph>ỳaó</emph>, added to
<emph>ḱiú</emph>, to go, gives us <emph>ngò ỳaó ḱiú</emph>, I will go, the first
germ of our futures. To say that <emph>ngò ỳaó ḱiú</emph> was the
necessary form of the future in Chinese would introduce
a fatalism into language which rests on no authority
whatever. The building up of language is not like
the building of the cells in a beehive, nor is it like the
building of St. Peter's by Michael Angelo. It is the
result of innumerable agencies, working each according
to certain laws, and leaving in the end the result of
their combined efforts freed from all that proved superfluous
or useless. From the first combination of two
<pb n='389'/><anchor id='Pg389'/>
such words as <emph>ģin</emph>, man, <emph>kiai</emph>, many, to form the plural
<emph>ģin kiai</emph>, to the perfect grammar of Sanskrit and Greek,
everything is intelligible as the result of the two principles
of growth which we considered in our second
Lecture. What is antecedent to the production of
roots is the work of nature; what follows after is the
work of man, not in his individual and free, but in his
collective and moderating, capacity.
</p>

<p>
I do not say that every form in Greek or Sanskrit
has as yet been analyzed and explained. There are
formations in Greek and Latin and English which
have hitherto baffled all tests; and there are certain
contrivances, such as the augment in Greek, the change
of vowels in Hebrew, the Umlaut and Ablaut in the
Teutonic dialects, where we might feel inclined to
suppose that language admitted distinctions purely
musical or phonetic, corresponding to very palpable
and material distinctions of thought. Such a supposition,
however, is not founded on any safe induction.
It may seem inexplicable to us why <emph>bruder</emph> in
German should form its plural as <emph>brüder</emph>; or <emph>brother</emph>,
<emph>brethren</emph>. But what is inexplicable and apparently
artificial in our modern languages becomes intelligible
in their more ancient phases. The change of <emph>u</emph> into
<emph>ü</emph>, as in <emph>bruder</emph>, <emph>brüder</emph>, was not intentional; least
of all was it introduced to expressed plurality. The
change is phonetic, and due to the influence of an
<emph>i</emph> or <emph>j</emph>,<note place='foot'>See Schleicher,
Deutsche Sprache, p. 144.</note> which existed originally in the last syllable
and which reacted regularly on the vowel of the
preceding syllable; nay, which leaves its effect behind,
even after it has itself disappeared. By a
false analogy such a change, perfectly justifiable in a
<pb n='390'/><anchor id='Pg390'/>
certain class of words, may be applied to other words
where no such change was called for; and it may
then appear as if an arbitrary change of vowels was
intended to convey a grammatical change. But even
into these recesses the comparative philologist can follow
language, thus discovering a reason even for what
in reality was irrational and wrong. It seems difficult
to believe that the augment in Greek should originally
have had an independent substantial existence, yet all
analogy is in favor of such a view. Suppose English
had never been written down before Wycliffe's time,
we should then find that in some instances the perfect
was formed by the mere addition of a short <emph>a</emph>. Wycliffe
spoke and wrote:<note place='foot'>Marsh, p. 388.</note>
<emph>I knowlech to a felid and seid
þus</emph>; <hi rend='italic'>i.e.</hi> I acknowledge to have felt and said thus.
In a similar way we read: <emph>it should a fallen</emph>; instead
of <q>it should have fallen;</q> and in some parts of
England common people still say very much the same:
<emph>I should a done it</emph>. Now in some old English books
this <emph>a</emph> actually coalesces with the verb, at least they
are printed together; so that a grammar founded on
them would give us <q>to fall</q> as the infinitive of the
present, <emph>to afallen</emph> as the infinitive of the past. I do
not wish for a moment to be understood as if there was
any connection between this <emph>a</emph>, a contraction of <emph>have</emph> in
English, and the Greek augment which is placed before
past tenses. All I mean is, that, if the origin of the
augment has not yet been satisfactorily explained, we
are not therefore to despair, or to admit an arbitrary
addition of a consonant or vowel, used as it were algebraically
or by mutual agreement, to distinguish a
past from a present tense.
</p>

<pb n='391'/><anchor id='Pg391'/>

<p>
If inductive reasoning is worth anything, we are
justified in believing that what has been proved to
be true on so large a scale, and in cases where it was
least expected, is true with regard to language in general.
We require no supernatural interference, nor any
conclave of ancient sages, to explain the realities of
human speech. All that is formal in language is the
result of rational combination; all that is material,
the result of a mental instinct. The first natural and
instinctive utterances, if sifted differently by different
clans, would fully account both for the first origin and
for the first divergence of human speech. We can understand
not only the origin of language, but likewise
the necessary breaking up of one language into many;
and we perceive that no amount of variety in the material
or the formal elements of speech is incompatible
with the admission of one common source.
</p>

<p>
The Science of Language thus leads us up to that
highest summit from whence we see into the very dawn
of man's life on earth; and where the words which we
have heard so often from the days of our childhood&mdash;<q>And
the whole earth was of one language and of one
speech</q>&mdash;assume a meaning more natural, more intelligible,
more convincing, than they ever had before.

And now in concluding this course of Lectures, I
have only to express my regret that the sketch of the
Science of Language which I endeavored to place before
you, was necessarily so very slight and imperfect.
There are many points which I could not touch at all,
many which I could only allude to: there is hardly
one to which I could do full justice. Still I feel grateful
to the President and the Council of this Institution
<pb n='392'/><anchor id='Pg392'/>
for having given me an opportunity of claiming some
share of public sympathy for a science which I believe
has a great future in store; and I shall be pleased, if,
among those who have done me the honor of attending
these Lectures, I have excited, though I could not have
satisfied, some curiosity as to the strata which underlie
the language on which we stand and walk; and as to
the elements which enter into the composition of the
very granite of our thoughts.
